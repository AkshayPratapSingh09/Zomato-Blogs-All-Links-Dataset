        "content": "The inception of Bakingo is a tale of foresight and ambition shared by three engineering friends\u2014Shrey Sehgal, Himanshu Chawla, and Suman Patra. As passionate foodies, they felt that their sweet cravings were never fully satisfied.\nIn many cities, only two or three prominent bakery brands thrived. What stood out, however, was the absence of a unified, national bakery brand \u2014 a gap that seemed impossible to ignore. This realization led Shrey, Himanshu, and Suman onto an exciting new venture!\nFrom simple concepts to sweet creations\nThe roots of Bakingo trace back to the trio\u2019s experience in running another venture, FlowerAura, a bootstrapped gifting business which they launched in 2011. What began in a modest basement steadily grew into a flourishing company. The valuable insights into logistics and operations that they got from those days, would later become pivotal to the creation and growth of Bakingo.\nAs first-generation entrepreneurs, the founders understood the significant risk they were taking by starting their own business. Suman says, \n\u201cWe met in college, stayed connected, and eventually decided to take a leap of faith and launch our first venture together.\u201d\nIn 2014-15, while running FlowerAura, the founders noticed that ordering a cake was inconvenient\u2014customers relied on local bakeries due to the absence of online delivery options. Moreover, the taste and quality of cakes varied widely from city to city, making it difficult for customers to find consistent, high-quality cakes across different parts of the country.\nThis is how they came up with the idea of launching Bakingo in 2016. The vision was simple, yet ambitious \u2013 deliver freshly baked, high-quality cakes and desserts right to customers\u2019 doorsteps.\nSince they had previously relied on vendors who were primarily spread across different states, they wished to monitor operations more closely when they established Bakingo. Recognizing the value of quality control, they set up dark stores which were entirely run by the brand.\nSuman says \n\u201c\nOur learnings from running FlowerAura helped us leverage our technological acumen to streamline operations, minimize wastage, and ensure customer-centric values were at the forefront of our business model\u201d\n.\nBy actively seeking and valuing customer feedback, Bakingo continually refines its products and services. This ensures that each interaction with the brand is memorable and delightful.\nThe brand also focuses on creating customized cakes for specific themes and occasions, such as birthdays, anniversaries, and festivals, ensuring that customers can find the perfect cake for every celebration.\nBakingo sets itself apart by using technology extensively to ensure that every process, from baking to delivery, is meticulously monitored and optimized. This results in minimal wastage and maximized freshness, guaranteeing that customers receive the best products possible.\nA dessert for every palate\nWhen Bakingo began, it wasn\u2019t just about making cakes\u2014it was about creating moments of joy for all. With over 200 unique cake designs and a tempting variety of desserts, Bakingo has grown into a brand that balances indulgence with affordability. But what truly sets it apart is the commitment to ensuring that everyone, regardless of their dietary preferences, can enjoy a slice of happiness. This includes a delicious assortment of eggless options for those with specific dietary preferences.\nDrawing inspiration from flavors around the world, they weave\u00a0 global influences into the fabric of Indian tastes. Whether it\u2019s the luxurious, eggless Tiramisu or the light, creamy Tres Leches, each creation is thoughtfully crafted to delight the diverse palates of their customers.\nThe founders have also gone a step further by launching various initiatives to cater to the diverse needs of their customers. One such innovation was changing the shape of their pastries to a square and placing them in a cup. This simple adjustment in dimensions helped prevent the cakes from toppling during transit, ensuring they arrived in perfect condition, just as they were intended.\nSuman says\n, \u201cWhen Bakingo started, the vision wasn\u2019t limited to just the metropolitan areas. We wanted to create a national bakery brand that was accessible to people in tier 2 and tier 3 cities as well.\u201d\nImproving reach through external collaborations\nBakingo\u2019s association with Zomato has been instrumental in making its delicious desserts accessible to a larger audience.\n \nBy leveraging Zomato\u2019s network, Bakingo boosts its distribution capabilities and customer satisfaction, ensuring that the products are handled and delivered with the same care and attention as they would in a physical bakery.\nIn the words of Suman,\n \n\u201cThe association with Zomato has enabled us to continuously innovate and adapt to market trends. The platform acted as a catalyst for our success \u2013 our order volume has grown 24 times over the past 6 years.\u201d \nSuman added that this growth allowed them to expand their delivery network across multiple cities in India.\n\u201cWe take a proactive approach on Zomato,\u201d\n \nSuman shared.\n \u201c\nFor the Mother\u2019s Day Photo Cake campaign, we were the first brand to pilot the initiative. We invested in the machinery and equipment needed to print photos on cakes and successfully activated it across over 90 Bakingo outlets in India.\u201d \nSuman also highlighted how vital it is to stay attuned to the constantly evolving trends and innovations in the food industry, ensuring that Bakingo consistently delights customers throughout the country.\nFuture plans and expansion\nWith a vision to spread joy through high-quality cakes and desserts, Bakingo has made significant strides since its inception. What began as a single outlet in one city has expanded to serve over 30 cities, with plans for further growth. With each expansion and every new customer, Bakingo\u2019s story continues to unfold.\nIn addition to its online food delivery business, Bakingo plans to launch retail stores in the Delhi NCR region. These outlets will allow customers to browse and select their favorite delicacies in person, adding a new dimension to the experience offered by the brand.\nBakingo\u2019s journey demonstrates how a simple idea, when nurtured with creativity, intellect, and perseverance, can evolve into something truly extraordinary."

What began as a spontaneous afternoon in 2011, soon became one of the most pivotal moments at Zomato\u2014the day I met Akriti Chopra.\nWhat followed was over a decade of unforgettable memories and countless milestones.\nIn hindsight Tuki, as we affectionately call her, has been the most crucial piece of this big, audacious Zomato puzzle\u2014a piece that seemed to fit perfectly, as if it had always belonged.\nAkriti has always had the knack for turning chaos into order and has always made the impossible seem effortless. She\u2019s been so much more than a leader or a colleague\u2014she has been the glue holding us all together. Or the countless moments when she provided the much needed \u201cadult supervision\u201d through some of our most complex financial transitions, with so much poise and patience.\nThrough all the various roles she\u2019s done at Zomato \u2013\u00a0being our Chief Financial Officer, or Chief People Officer, and of-course the catch-all role as our co-founder\u2014she has maintained that signature \u2018Tuki Charm\u2019\u2014a perfect balance of fierce determination, utmost humility, and a love for Zomato that\u2019s \nalmost\n impossible to replicate.\nZomato wouldn\u2019t be what it is today without her wisdom, her unyielding optimism, and her belief in all of us, and in me\u2014even when we had no idea what we were doing.\nWith time, Zomato evolved, and we did too. A few months ago, Akriti shared with me that she wanted to hang her boots at Eternal (our internal name for Zomato + Blinkit + District + Hyperpure), to focus on long-deferred personal aspirations and pursuits. This includes her health, her relationships, and the life experiences she\u2019s had on her bucket list since she was five years old\u2014things that the demands of startup life don\u2019t always leave room for.\nOf course, she assured me that she will be here for as long as needed, helping the team to stand on their own without needing her day to day support. I am proud to say that over the last few months, we have achieved the exit goal that we set out for her, with her.\nTuki, as you set off on your next adventure, I truly hope you find what your heart seeks. And I hope you know that I will always be cheering you on every step of the way. You say that I don\u2019t need you anymore, but I respectfully disagree. Here at Eternal, your spirit will live on \u2013 and I will replace your presence during our toughest moments with a question we will collectively ask ourselves \u2013 \u201cwhat would Tuki do?\u201d\nThank you for being the gold standard of what it means to be human.\nWith love and gratitude,\nDeepi"

        "author": "Shuvra Saha",
        "content": "Starting as a small eatery in Juhu in 1984, Naturals soon blossomed into a treasured ice cream parlor known for its commitment to authentic, fruit-based flavors.\nNaturals has now marked 40 years as a legacy brand, with over 170 successful outlets across 15 Indian states. The brand is celebrated for its pioneering flavors like Sitaphal, Tender Coconut, Jackfruit, Muskmelon, and Kala Jamun.\nAn Ode to Late Mr. Raghunandan Kamath\nMr. Raghunandan Kamath, the man behind the brand, grew up in the bustling streets of Mangalore. It was his father, a mango seller, who taught him how to select the perfect fruit, understand its ripeness, and preserve its flavors.\nLater, while working at his brother\u2019s restaurant, Mr. Raghunandan Kamath noticed something curious: while ice creams were packed with fruity flavors, they rarely ever had real fruits themselves. And just like that, the idea behind Naturals Ice Cream was born. Combining learnings about fruits from his father and knowledge of restaurants from his brother, he envisioned something that would change the way we enjoy ice creams forever.\nCarving a Niche\nFollowing\n \nin his father\u2019s footsteps, Siddhant Kamath, present Director of Naturals Ice Cream, joined the business in 2013.\nHe says \n\u201cIn 2015, soon after I joined, we gave our brand a makeover.\n \nWe were entering the capital city at the time and wanted to build a brand that everybody could feel a part of, no matter where they were from or how old they were. So we revamped our story to create wholesome experiences that bring people together.\u201d\nIt was at this stage that the famous tagline \u201cTaste the Original\u201d was created, one that showcases the uniqueness of the brand, while capturing its true essence.\nAs an artisanal brand, Naturals uses a simple approach in crafting its ice creams. It brings together three key ingredients\u2014milk, fruits, and sugar\u2014to create a variety of mouthwatering flavors. Unlike commercial ice cream brands, Naturals\u2019 products are free from preservatives, emulsifiers, and artificial flavoring.\nSiddhant adds\n, \n\u201cOur ice creams are made with about 70% milk, and not just any milk\u2014we use buffalo milk, sourced straight from a farm run by a close associate of my father. To this, we add real fruits that are carefully processed at our factories.\u201d\nThe ice creams are so rich and creamy that every scoop bursts with fruit-filled deliciousness.\nCelebrating a Glorious Journey\nThe brand has now earned global recognition, with Tender Coconut being rated among the Top 100 most iconic ice creams by Taste Atlas. The immensely popular flavor originated in 1992-93, when Mr. Raghunandan Kamath realized that he wanted to create a unique and special experience for his customers.\nThat\u2019s when it struck him, the thought of making an ice cream with the very same ingredients that go into a panchamrit offering. If milk, sugar and coconut could be offered to the Gods during auspicious occasions, they could certainly be turned into a memorable ice cream experience.\nNaturals was listed among the top 10 most trusted brands in India in a KPMG survey conducted in 2018. They have also won the Gold Medal for Innovation for their Cucumber flavor and the Bronze Medal for their Vanilla flavor in The Great Indian Ice Creams Contest. This goes a long way in showing how customers and corporations alike, value Natural\u2019s as an iconic ice cream brand.\nMoving beyond a Retail-First Approach\u00a0\nAs a retail-first brand, Naturals focuses on providing an exceptional in-store experience. However, they also realize the importance of online delivery in the food and beverage industry today. In fact, they were one of the first movers in the ice cream category to leverage online delivery to reach customers.\nSiddhant Kamath, says\n,\n \u201cOur partnership with Zomato began in 2015, making us one of the first ice cream parlors to offer food ordering and delivery online. This collaboration has driven a 30% annual growth in our online delivery business, enabling Naturals to adapt to India\u2019s evolving food delivery landscape while maintaining our legacy of offering authentic ice creams in retail stores.\u201d\nThe partnership with Zomato was particularly useful during the COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly hurt the restaurant industry. Here\u2019s where Zomato\u2019s extensive reach and delivery network came in handy.\nSiddhant says,\n\u201cStrengthening our collaboration with Zomato for ordering and delivery was a strategic move that allowed us to keep serving our existing customers and even expand our reach during the lockdown.\u201d\nPartnering with Zomato ensured that Naturals ice creams could reach customers, despite their short shelf life. Now, customers could enjoy their favorite ice cream flavors, right from the comfort of their homes.\nSiddhant adds, \n\u201cWe are actively working on product development and exploring new segments within the ice cream space. We wish to double up our stores in the next 3-5 years and go international very soon. Our goal is to continuously innovate while growing sustainably, so we can keep up with changing consumer preferences.\u201d\nNaturals seamlessly blends the rich legacy of Late Mr. Raghunandan Kamath with Siddhant Kamath\u2019s bold and forward-thinking approach. This powerful combination ensures that the brand turns every scoop into a joyful celebration of genuine flavors for customers around the globe."

POS systems also play a crucial role in ensuring smooth order processing and operations management.

As the restaurant industry scales, there is a need to enable POS players, both new and existing, to be able to solve problems in a quick and efficient manner for more restaurants.\nAs a first step to achieve this goal, Zomato has launched a developer platform for POS partners, to ensure quick, reliable integrations that enhance restaurant operations. This platform will offer easy-to-read documentation, real-time API testing, and an entire tool-kit for POS developers, thereby enabling POS partners to introduce many more features at scale.\nKey Features\nZomato\u2019s POS Developer Platform is built to streamline integration and make life easier for POS developers, with features that include:\nQuick onboarding and integration\n: Developers can easily create an account and access easy-to-read integration guide; providing step-by-step instructions, reducing confusion and saving valuable development time.\nUnified API documentation\n: The platform brings all API technical documentation together in one place, making it simple for developers to find what they need.\nReal-time API testing\n: POS partners can test APIs and webhooks in real time, which speeds up the development process by allowing immediate troubleshooting.\nWith Zomato\u2019s new developer platform, POS partners can now roll out new features for restaurants quickly in significantly shorter development cycles, allowing restaurants to focus on what matters most: making awesome food and offering a great customer experience.\nIf you\u2019re a POS partner looking to streamline your integration with Zomato, the new Developer Platform is ready for you.

What if I forgot about that wedding I had to attend? We want to make it as easy as possible to book a ticket to an event, as early as possible, without having to worry about anything else. This is precisely why we built our own \u2018Book Now, Sell Anytime\u2019 feature \u2013 a first of its kind by an Indian ticketing platform.\nSo how does it work?\nCustomers can buy tickets to their favorite event as soon as they go live on the Zomato app.\nIf their plans change for any reason, they can list their ticket on the Zomato app at their chosen price (capped at the organizer\u2019s discretion)\nOnce another customer purchases this listed ticket, the seller\u2019s ticket is canceled and a new ticket is issued to the customer purchasing this ticket \u2013 issued and authenticated by Zomato.\nThe seller will get the full value of their listed price transferred to their preferred payment method (subject to applicable taxes).\nOur hope is that this feature is utilized for the right reasons by our genuine customers. We also want to ensure this does not promote ill practices in the events industry such as black market touting or unfair pricing. Therefore, we have put a few checks and balances in place:\nA customer can buy up to 10 tickets per category which can be listed for selling\nWe will be constantly monitoring the platform so that customers do not take advantage of this feature\nEach event will be capped at a certain value\nWe hope this new feature empowers all our customers and removes any second-guessing about being able to book tickets in advance to events they love. The feature will go live on the Zomato app for the Zomato Feeding India Concert a couple of weeks before the event. This is another step towards building a truly customer-first platform and growing this industry in India.\nWe will continue to grow and evolve this initiative as we go along.

        "author": "Shuvra Saha",
        "content": "Samosa Party was born out of a passion to elevate Indian ethnic snacking to a whole new level. The idea was simple yet ambitious: to make Indian street food hygienic, reliable, available round-the-clock and comparable to international food outlets.\nIn the words of Diksha, co-founder of Samosa Party, \u201cAs Indians, we tend to snack a lot more than our global counterparts. However, my co-founder Amit and I identified a gap \u2013 the snacking scene was either dominated by local, unorganized vendors or generic packaged food. There wasn\u2019t a single brand offering organized ethnic snacks at a national scale.\u201d\nEnter Samosa Party! Diksha goes on to say \u201cIndian snacks have been stuck with a reputation for being street-side offerings and largely unhygienic. We wanted to transform the way people perceive and enjoy them, by offering the same level of quality and organization as their favorite fast foods. So, we set out to create a brand that celebrates the joy of Indian snacking in a clean, modern, and fun way.\u201d\nRaising a toast to the magic makers\nThe heart and soul of Samosa Party lies in the dedication of its founders, Amit Nanwani and Diksha Pande. They have personally worked on the R&D for multiple products and the freshly-fried samosa concept for almost two years, before taking them live. While Amit\u2019s eye (or should we say tongue :P) for great food and ingredients is unparalleled, Diksha\u2019s forte is people and customer experience.\nDiksha says, \u201cWe started working on the concept in 2017 as a part time gig and received lots of love from customers. It was only in 2020 that we quit our jobs and got into a full-time career making samosas. Since then, we have expanded to run 65 outlets across three metro cities.\u201d\nShining through adversities\nThe biggest challenge that the brand encountered was in convincing customers to pay a slight premium for what many saw as a budget product. Then, in an unexpected twist, COVID-19 hit. Suddenly, they became the go-to option for reliable, hygienic snacking and indulgence, proving that a little extra investment in quality goes a long way. Even in the face of adversity, Samosa Party found a way to shine!\nShe goes on to say,\n \n\u201cZomato has been an incredible partner in our journey. When we set out to make Indian snacks like samosas popular, the platform enabled us to reach millions of people. With Zomato, our order volume has grown 21 times over the past four years. We have unlocked thousands of customers and doubled down on existing ones using tools such as Deal of the Day offers.\nWhereas traditionally, samosas have always been an evening snack, we\u2019ve been able to expand the offering across mealtimes. The platform has not only helped us deliver delicious snacks quickly but has also played a crucial role in making our dream of popularizing Indian snacks a reality.\u201d\nUnique selling point: Simple yet delightful\nContinuous innovation is the DNA of Samosa Party.\nDiksha says \u201cOur innovative products like Party Buckets and Samosa Corners are designed to make the snacking experience unforgettable. Here, we\u2019re not just making samosas; we\u2019re creating memories, one delicious bite at a time.\u201d\nTheir latest creation, the Dippin Volcano Samosa Bucket range, is a testament to their commitment to pushing the boundaries of innovation. Imagine gourmet samosas across various flavors, such as corn and cheese, noodles, tandoori chicken tikka, molten chocolate, paired with unique premium dips and sprinkles like never before\u2014an explosion of flavors that\u2019s truly extraordinary.\nThe owners aspire to take Indian snacking to the world!\nDiksha and Amit have a grand vision to make Samosa Party a global phenomenon, spreading the love for Indian snacks far and wide. Their ambition goes beyond just serving samosas; they aim to share a piece of India\u2019s rich culinary tradition with every corner of the globe.\nDiksha says, \u201cThere\u2019s a huge need for a scalable Indian brand that proudly represents our rich culinary heritage. Our mission is to become the go-to QSR of Indian food for global citizens.\u201d With their innovative products and unwavering commitment to quality, Diksha and Amit are all set to redefine how the world experiences Indian snacks."

        "content": "At Zomato, ensuring the reliability of our systems is paramount, as any downtime can affect millions of customers using our services. \nIn 2018, we relied on a single Grafana server on an EC2 instance, backed by a single Prometheus server, and New Relic for monitoring system health. However, with Zomato\u2019s growth, we recognized the need for a more robust, scalable in-house monitoring solution. Given the rapidly increasing number of micro services and their custom metrics, along with critical infrastructure metrics such as Envoy and overall system health, we couldn\u2019t afford any gaps in our monitoring capabilities. We needed a solution that could track the health of our metrics reliably and scale with our growth.\nPrometheus, the de-facto choice for monitoring tools at the time, along with Thanos for enhanced scalability, reliability, and long-term storage, emerged as the perfect fit. We adopted this solution and scaled it as Zomato continued to grow, ensuring that we could maintain high observability and system reliability.\nThe initial Prometheus and Thanos setup\nHere\u2019s what our setup looked like:\nPrometheus for metric collection and short term storage, Thanos for high availability and long-term storage\nMulti-AZ setup for high availability\nAWS ECS Services running on 100% spot EC2 instances\nTotal Prometheus servers: 144 (1a+1b), Thanos querier, Thanos stores, Thanos frontend and Thanos compactor\nChallenges at Scale\nWe are truly grateful to the Prometheus and Thanos communities for the incredible system they\u2019ve built and supported over the years. However, we soon realized that the current setup might not sustain our anticipated growth.\nAs Zomato\u2019s business expanded and our monoliths evolved into micro services, our metrics volume exploded, revealing several issues in the Thanos and Prometheus stack:\nMemory Issues:\n Our Prometheus servers started crashing with Out Of Memory (OOM) errors frequently due to resource-intensive high cardinality queries.\nWAL corruptions:\n Write-Ahead Log (WAL) corruption led to OOM and slow startup times.\nSlower Queries:\n High query response time when querying Prometheus and AWS S3 via Thanos store.\nFalse Alerts:\n False no_data alerts due to metric loss in case of spot interruptions and longer startup time\nMounting Costs:\n High cardinality led to high resource consumption, requiring very large instances (r5.16xlarge) and memory allocations ranging from 40 GB to 250 GB for each Prometheus server. Thanos stores also required 460 GB memory.\nThe Wake-Up Call: NYE Degradation\nOn New Year\u2019s Eve, we witness a massive surge in orders and customer interactions, pushing our systems to the limits. However, we encountered a brief outage in our observability platform at the peak of NYE. The cause? An influx of concurrent users accessing resource-intensive queries from dashboards, which strained our observability stack.\nExploring Alternatives and Discovering VictoriaMetrics\nRealizing that our current setup might not meet future growth, we began exploring alternatives. Leveraging our experience with Prometheus, we defined key criteria for our next platform. We explored some paid alternatives as well, but all of them came with a hefty price tag, significantly higher than our in-house setup cost.\nAfter evaluating various options, we discovered VictoriaMetrics, which fulfilled almost all our expectations. Our criteria included:\nDistributed System: Does it avoid single point of failure, as is the case with Prometheus?\nYes, VictoriaMetrics is fully distributed with each component serving a specific purpose \u2014 vmselect, vmstorage, vminsert, vmagent, vmauth, vmalert. Please go through \nthis\n doc for more details on each vm component.\nQuick Startup: Can it start quickly in case of spot interruptions?\nYes, being a distributed system with lightweight services, each component starts up impressively fast, well within the two-minute spot interruption window.\nImproved Query Response Time: Can it improve query response time?\nVictoriaMetrics demonstrated significant improvements, especially since all data resides on EBS with much lower latencies and higher throughput as compared with S3. During POC, we found that some Grafana panels, like those showing orders placed every 30 seconds, saw response times drop by up to 1/3rd.\nHandling High Cardinality and Churn Rate: Can it handle high cardinality and churn rate?\nVictoriaMetrics is highly optimized and can handle high cardinality efficiently, which was crucial for our fully containerized production environment running hundreds of micro services on AWS ECS backed by 100% AWS EC2 spot instances.\nMetric Aggregation: Is there an alternative that can aggregate metrics and reduce time series?\nTo our surprise, VictoriaMetrics supports streaming aggregation to aggregate data before ingestion into the system, which helps reduce unnecessary cardinality and the number of metrics. This feature was particularly appealing to us. Let\u2019s try to understand this feature better with an example: \nYou can see that id has cardinality 2, city_id 1 and instance 4, so overall cardinality of metric order_placed is 8. With streaming aggregation, we can drop instance label and aggregate the remaining series. Removing instance label reduces cardinality to just 2, down from 8, thereby significantly cutting down storage requirements, lowering costs, and enhancing performance.\nFor more details, please refer to \nthis\n documentation.\nScalability: Can it handle our ever-growing scale?\nScalability is a crucial criterion for us. During NYE 2024, we handled 2.2 billion active time series with an ingestion rate of 17.5 million samples per second. We sought a system that\u2019s already battle-tested with traffic much higher than ours. VictoriaMetrics has been tested with an ingestion rate of 100 million samples per second and already has a case study with active time series much higher than ours. See \nthis\n and \nthis\n for more details. This gave us confidence and a go-ahead signal.\nVisibility and Monitoring: Can it offer better visibility into what goes into the system and areas for optimization?\nVictoriaMetrics has VMUI, an incredible source for monitoring what\u2019s there in the system. Cardinality explorer provides insights into the top time series, label=value contributors. See \nthis\n for more details. Below image is from our setup:\nMigration Effort: Can we complete migration with minimal effort and time?\nVictoriaMetrics addressed this concern as well, offering a complete drop-in replacement for the current Prometheus stack. We realized that we don\u2019t have to put much effort if we have the correct migration strategy in place.\nPOC and mini load test before the migration\nBefore embarking on the big migration, we decided to conduct a small POC. On December 23rd 2023, we deployed VictoriaMetrics in cluster mode to handle all our application metrics, which also served as a standby for NYE 2024. We ingested eight days worth of application metrics and performed load testing on the system. The results were impressive, demonstrating significant reductions in query execution time as well as disk and memory utilization.\nThe Big Migration\nFollowing New Year\u2019s Eve 2024, in mid-January 2024, we began crafting the migration plan. Overhauling the entire observability stack initially seemed daunting, but with the right approach and tools, we managed to execute a seemingly smooth migration.\nWhen deciding on the migration strategy, we deliberated on the following key questions:\nHow many dashboards and panels need to be migrated?\nWhat would be the optimal setup? How many different VM clusters do we need?\nHow should we manage configurations, recording rules, and alerting rules?\nWhat strategy should we employ for migrating the data?\nHow could we validate the correctness of metrics and alerts?\nCould we optimize and reduce current usage through cleanup efforts?\nHow should benchmarking be conducted?\nHere are the details which answer all the above questions:\nSize of the migration\nThe Setup\nWe categorized metrics into two environments: preprod, and prod, and two types:\nInfrastructure metrics\n: including Envoy mesh, cAdvisor, EKS, Kafka, MQTT, and others, which contribute 80%.\nService metrics:\n consisting of application-specific business metrics from our microservices, contributing 20%.\nBased on this categorization, we decided to create three VM clusters: preprod (dedicated to all preprod metrics), infra prod, and svc prod. These clusters are replicated across two Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability and resiliency. Each cluster operates with its own vmselect instance that reads from both AZs. We utilize vmauth as a proxy to route metrics to the appropriate vmselect.\nHere\u2019s an overview of how the setup is structured:\nThe entire VM Stack runs on AWS ECS, utilizing AWS EBS and 100% EC2 spot instances. We use the rexray plugin to mount EBS volumes onto ECS tasks. Requests from Grafana are directed to AWS ALB, which then routes them to vmauth as shown in the above architecture.\nConfiguration Management\nWe adopted a GitOps-based approach to synchronize vmagent, vmalert, and vmauth configurations with AWS EFS. All alerting and recording rules are organized in folders within our common GitHub repository. Upon merging a pull request (PR), configuration files are synced to AWS EFS using AWS CodeBuild as shown above. VM components retrieve configurations from this EFS every 30 seconds. Here\u2019s a sample outline of our GitOps structure\nMigration Steps\nHere are the steps we took during the migration process:\nData Scraping and Ingestion\n: We configured VMagents for each cluster to scrape and ingest data similarly to Prometheus. Since VM is fully compatible with Prometheus, this transition was smooth. As we ingested more metrics, we scaled by adding additional VMAgent shards and VMStorage nodes. This scaling also allowed us to verify that there was no disruption or impact on the plotted graphs.\nDashboard Updates\n: Recognizing the impracticality of manually migrating thousands of dashboards, we developed a script to update Grafana dashboard panels with labels and datasource configurations.\nInitial Dashboard Migration\n: After accumulating a month\u2019s worth of data, we prioritized migrating our internal SRE dashboards first to address early issues. Subsequently, we engaged with service owners tier by tier, migrating dashboards based on their criticality. This approach helped us identify and resolve issues proactively before affecting critical services.\nAlert Verification\n: To ensure continuity, we configured a duplicate alert manager and routed all alerts triggered by vmalert to it. Throughout the migration, we regularly compared alerts generated by Prometheus and vmalert to validate their consistency.\nFinal Stack Transition\n: Once all dashboards were successfully migrated, we phased out read load from the Thanos querier and eventually decommissioned the entire old stack.\nThese structured steps ensured a smooth transition while maintaining operational reliability and minimizing disruptions.\nReducing Metrics: Optimizing the usage\nWhen we hit \n2.2 billion active time series\n on NYE, we asked ourselves a question: Do we actually need this many time series to monitor our systems, or can we remove and drop certain metrics?\nDuring the migration, we picked the cleanup track and removed unused dashboards, alerts, and metrics.\nTo identify unused high cardinality metrics, we used VictoriaMetrics\u2019 cardinality explorer and the \nGrafana-wtf\n tool. These tools enabled us to pinpoint metrics and histogram buckets that contributed the most by percentage. We then verified their usage in Grafana panels using the Grafana-wtf tool. If a metric wasn\u2019t used in any panel and we confirmed it wasn\u2019t needed, we dropped it. It turned out that the top contributors were Envoy mesh metrics. Some of the top unused metrics that we dropped include:\nenvoy_cluster_lb_subsets_active\nenvoy_cluster_max_host_weight\nenvoy_cluster_lb_zone_no_capacity_left\nenvoy_cluster_upstream_cx_length_ms_sum\nenvoy_cluster_circuit_breakers_high_rq_retry_open\nenvoy_cluster_lb_subsets_fallback_panic\nenvoy_cluster_lb_subsets_created\nWe also removed a lot of unused histogram buckets from certain high cardinality metrics. Here\u2019s a sample drop configuration\nResults from this exercise\n40% reduction in active time series\n200 unused dashboards deleted\nLoad Test: Pushing the limits\nRead load test:\nWe used Grafana\u2019s \nk6 tool\n to load test read traffic, simulating 800 concurrent users and 30,000 queries per minute \u2014 4 times our average load. The query timeout was set to 10s. Below are the load test results for VictoriaMetrics, compared to a similar load test conducted on the Thanos stack \u2013\nWrite load test:\nThe write load was tested during our infrastructure scale-up test, which we conducted recently for Mother\u2019s Day, another high-volume business day besides New Year\u2019s Eve. We scaled up EC2 instances and ECS services by 2 to 2.5x. This increase in infrastructure significantly multiplied the metrics count, thanks to the cardinality, resulting in a 2x increase in the ingestion rate and facilitating the load test.\nHurdles and Hiccups: Migration challenges\nIncrease vs Rate func:\n Incorrect graphs appeared in many Grafana panels when using the rate function. We had to manually ask teams to fix this. Please see this \nGitHub issue\n for details.\nMinStaleness:\n We encountered unexpected data staleness and gaps while plotting some metrics on Grafana. By default, Prometheus has a lookback of 5 minutes, but in VictoriaMetrics, we had to explicitly set the minStalenessInterval. See this \nGithub issue\n for more details.\nStreaming Aggregation:\n Unfortunately, we could not use the streaming aggregation feature due to the nature of our multi-AZ setup. We were seeing random data and spikes during spot interruptions and vmagent rotations. After a detailed discussion with the VictoriaMetrics team, they suggested a solution that we are yet to try.\nGaps in cAdvisor Metrics:\n To address this, we had to set honor_timestamp to false in the configuration. Eventually, VictoriaMetrics team fixed this by setting it to false by default. See this \nGitHub issue\n for more details.\nVersion Upgrades:\n During the migration, three new versions were released, with the latest version including critical bug fixes and some features we needed. This was not an issue as such. In fact, this allowed us to test the resiliency of the system during upgrades. We followed the \nno-downtime strategy\n\u00a0and observed no issues during the process.\nImpact of this mighty exercise\nAlong with the above significant optimizations due to both the \nVictoriaMetrics adoption\n and the \ncleanup task\n we picked, this migration greatly enhanced the system\u2019s reliability and resiliency \u2013\nReliability\n: No metric loss events, significantly better reliability, and no false alerts due to no_data.\nMonitoring\n: Improved monitoring and visibility with the official VictoriaMetrics \ngrafana dashboards\n and VMUI component.\nLimitations: Missing features\nVictoriaMetrics lacks some features (available only in enterprise version) that were available in Thanos:\nDownsampling:\n Thanos provides downsampling, but in VictoriaMetrics, this feature is available only in the enterprise version. Before starting the migration, we thought we would be able to retain metrics for a longer retention period. Unfortunately, we have to keep the same retention period to keep costs under control. There are ways to achieve downsampling, such as setting up a parallel scraper and scraping at 5-minute or 1-hour intervals, then ingesting metrics into a different cluster. However, we decided not to go with this approach.\nIndexdb Rotation Period:\n Due to high cardinality and churn rate, our indexdb size is 10 times the data size. While data cleanup happens regularly during background merges, indexdb cleanup occurs only at the end of the retention cycle in vmstorage. Thus, we have to provision double disk capacity to accommodate this large index size, incurring some extra costs.\nQuery Caching:\n In-memory caching is not fully utilized due to frequent spot instance rotations. Thanos frontend comes with external caching support, which is favorable for our setup.\nQuery Splitting:\n We are awaiting this feature in vmselect. In the meantime, we might use Thanos query frontend. For reference \u2013 \ngithub issue\nAutomatic VMStorage Node Discovery:\n This feature is available in Thanos but, unfortunately, only in the enterprise version of VictoriaMetrics. Every time we need to add vmstorage nodes, we have to manually add vmstorage endpoints in vmselect and vminsert command lines and rotate the stack. This process is cumbersome given the large setup we have.\nRandom Spikes in Histogram Metrics During VMStorage Rotation:\n Recently, we have observed random spikes and incorrect graphs in some panels using histogram metrics. Upon investigation, we found that this occurs during EC2 spot interruptions of vmstorage nodes. We are looking into this issue, and there is a related open \ngithub issue\n\u00a0on it.\nDespite all the limitations, we are happy with the migration results and grateful to the VictoriaMetrics team.\nA comparative look between the setups\nOkay! So what next?\nLooking ahead, we plan to add the following enhancements to our system:\nEnhance the capabilities of our VM controller to include provisioning, management, and on-demand scaling of VM resources. Right now, it syncs configuration files to AWS EFS.\nPotentially introduce Thanos frontend for query splitting and caching, while disabling caching on vmselect, until this feature is added in vmselect itself.\nIntroduce a separate cluster for streaming aggregation, with one vmagent, instead of two, scraping and duplicating metrics to two separate VM clusters in different availability zones (AZs), as suggested by the VictoriaMetrics team.\nAdd multi retention support.\nIn conclusion, migrating to VictoriaMetrics has been a game-changer for our observability platform at Zomato. This overhaul addressed the challenges we faced with Prometheus and Thanos, allowing us to reduce costs, improve query response times, and enhance overall system performance. The migration process, though complex, was meticulously planned and executed, ensuring a smooth transition without disrupting our operations.\nThis blog was authored by \nAbhishek Jain\n in collaboration with \nAyush Chauhan\n, \nNishant Saraff\n and \nRiya Kumari\n under the guidance of \nHimanshu Rathore\n ."

        "author": "Sakib Malik",
        "content": "Imagine this: you\u2019re in a war room atmosphere. Tension hangs thick in the air as your application team and you scramble to debug a sudden spike in OOM issues plaguing your application\u2019s containers. No memory leaks seem to be the culprit, but further investigation reveals a shocking truth: the garbage collector (GC) wasn\u2019t running when it should have been! This crucial cleanup process failed to free up memory before the memory breached the container\u2019s hard limit, triggering those dreaded OOM issues.\nNow, let\u2019s look at a different scenario. You\u2019re analyzing your application\u2019s performance profile, and a particular pattern jumps out. A significant chunk of your application\u2019s CPU usage is being devoured by the GC. While your service doesn\u2019t necessarily require a ton of live heap memory, the constant GC activity is eating away at valuable resources. You have a hunch \u2013 what if you could streamline the GC process, making it more efficient?These two seemingly unrelated situations hold the key to unlocking a powerful new tool in GoLang: \nGOMEMLIMIT\nThe memory maze: Why did we need it?\nWhile GoLang, like many languages, utilizes a garbage collector (GC) for automated memory management, pre-1.19 versions offered limited control, fostering the potential for OOM issues and inefficient GC management in high memory applications. The crux of the issue lay in:\nGOGC and the Twice the Trouble:\n Previously, Go relied on the \nGOGC\n environment variable (defaulting to 100) to trigger GC cycles. This initiated garbage collection roughly at \ntwice the live heap size \n(live heap is that part of the memory that is being used actively by your application and cannot be reclaimed by the garbage collector) as identified in the previous GC cycle, and it didn\u2019t take into account your application\u2019s memory hard limit\nThe OOM Trap:\n The problem arose when this \ndoubled live heap\n size GC target surpassed the application\u2019s memory hard limit, inevitably resulting in OOM issues.\nGC CPU wastage: \nFor high memory applications with low live heap size, this doubled live heap size was lower compared to the memory hard limit, causing frequent GC cycle consumption, leading to high GC CPU usage.\nThe memory guardian: GOMEMLIMIT\nGOMEMLIMIT\n is a godsend for memory-hungry Go applications like ours at Zomato. It acts as a soft memory limit for the heap, gently nudging the garbage collector to work its magic more frequently when memory usage gets close to a defined threshold (GOMEMLIMIT) which is set to be less than the application\u2019s memory hard limit (to prevent OOM issue) and also saving CPU cycles by not running GC unnecessarily. This proactive approach prevents OOM crashes caused by inefficient garbage collection and keeps our applications running smoothly and consistently.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that GOMEMLIMIT cannot solve memory leaks. A memory leak occurs when your application holds onto some memory (live heap) that the garbage collector cannot reclaim. If the live heap itself exceeds the application\u2019s hard memory limit, even GOMEMLIMIT won\u2019t be able to prevent an OOM issue.\nIntroducing: Zomato/Go/Runtime Library\nIn order to implement \nGOMEMLIMIT\n for our applications, we took the initiative to develop our in -house \nZomato/go/runtime\n library, simplifying the process for application developers. This library boasts the following functionalities:\nDynamic GOMEMLIMIT Calculation:\nThis feature eliminates the guesswork by dynamically calculating the optimal \nGOMEMLIMIT\n value during runtime. It considers the following factors:\nECS Task and Container Constraints:\n The library analyzes the memory limits set for both the ECS task and individual containers to arrive at a dynamic value for \nGOMEMLIMIT\n at runtime\nReal-time Memory Usage:\n It retrieves up-to-date information on the current memory usage of the task at fixed intervals, this data is then used to dynamically calculate the optimal \nGOMEMLIMIT\n value with our homegrown algorithm using \nruntime/debug.SetMemoryLimit\n for setting the limit and the \nECS task Metadata Endpoint\n \nfor retrieving real-time container memory usage and memory limits.\nGOMAXPROCS\nSetting the GOMAXPROCS environment variable to an optimal value is required to avoid \nthrashing\n and to reduce unnecessary CPU throttling, our library achieves this by setting it based on ECS task level CPU hard limit.\nEnhanced Monitoring with Runtime Metrics Integration\nThis library goes beyond dynamic \nGOMEMLIMIT\n calculation. It leverages the Go runtime library to export crucial metrics related to:\nGarbage Collection:\n Track GC activity to identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies\nHeap:\n Monitor memory allocation and utilization patterns to understand memory pressure within the application\nMemory:\n Gain insights into overall memory usage and potential areas for optimization\nCPU:\n Analyze CPU usage patterns and identify potential correlations with GC activity\nECS Task Limits:\n Monitor current memory usage compared to imposed ECS task limits, ensuring adherence to resource constraints\nUnveiling the Impact: A deep dive into our memory management success \ud83d\ude80\nWe integrated \nZomato/go/runtime \nlibrary in over \n250\n of our golang microservices , which yielded impressive outcomes:\nReduced GC CPU Usage by more than 95%:\n GOMEMLIMIT intelligently triggers garbage collection only when necessary, saving valuable CPU cycles for other critical tasks. This resulted in a remarkable reduction of overall CPU usage of our applications by up to \n25%-50% \n(which in turn leads to equivalent reduction in our \nEC2\n \ncompute\n \ncosts \ud83d\udcc8\n). This substantial improvement empowers our applications to operate with greater efficiency handling higher loads with\nincreased ease, GC CPU usage dropped significantly, from a considerable \n25%-60%\n \n(~25% on average) \ndown to under \n2% \nfor most of our applications (a decrease of around \n90%\n on average)\nEnhanced Stability:\n By establishing a soft memory limit on when to run the GC, \nGOMEMLIMIT\n demonstrably reduced the risk of unexpected OOM \u274c issues and application crashes. This translates to a more reliable and stable user experience for our valued Zomato customers.\nReduced CPU throttling: \nBy adjusting \nGOMAXPROCS\n to the optimal value using our library, we have reduced cpu throttling for our applications by up to \n50%.\nEnhanced connection management\n: By reducing CPU%, each application requires less number of containers to serve the same number of requests, so each downstream application has to maintain less number of connections to our application, reducing load on our service mesh.\nEasy Debugging\n: Runtime library exports important metrics related to garbage collector, heap, memory, cpu and ecs task limits which help debug issues during incidents and also in setting up alerting on critical metrics\nCost Optimizations: \nBy optimizing CPU usage and reducing the number of required AWS ECS tasks / EC2 instances, \nGOMEMLIMIT\n contributed to huge \ncost savings of around 30,000 USD per month\n.\nThe takeaway: Empowering developers\nAt Zomato, we\u2019re constantly pushing the boundaries to enhance our platform\u2019s stability and efficiency. Our latest innovation, GOMEMLIMIT, is a testament to our commitment to delivering seamless experiences through optimized performance.\nGOMEMLIMIT empowers our developers with unparalleled control over memory and CPU usage. By significantly reducing out-of-memory (OOM) errors and optimizing garbage collection, this powerful feature not only improves application performance but also delivers substantial cost savings. It has proven invaluable in enhancing the scalability and reliability of our applications, ensuring that Zomato remains at the forefront of technological innovation.\nAs part of our ongoing commitment to innovation, we are excited to announce our plans to implement \nProfile-Guided Optimization (\nPGO\n) \nin GoLang, starting with the upcoming Go 1.20 release. \nPGO\n utilizes real-world profiling data to guide the compiler in making more informed optimization decisions, promising to further enhance runtime performance by \n2-14%\n. This initiative underscores our dedication to leveraging cutting-edge technologies to drive continuous improvement across our platform.\nJoin us in shaping the future of technology\nAt Zomato, we believe in creating an environment where innovation thrives and where every team member contributes to our success. Our commitment to excellence is reflected in initiatives like GOMEMLIMIT and our upcoming implementation of PGO.

        "content": "At Zomato, we\u2019re committed to building an inclusive world by sharing our learnings from our own experiences with creating a diverse workforce in our company and value chain. In our \nprevious diversity dialogue\n, we talked about the business benefits of having women in warehouses and dark stores. This one is dedicated to our learnings from an 18 month long journey of onboarding over 400 Persons with Disabilities onto Zomato\u2019s platform as delivery partners.\nDelivering food and livelihoods: The role of gig work in empowering PwDs\nIndia has over 26.8 million\n1\n people living with disabilities, 31%\n2\n of whom reside in urban cities. Despite supportive laws and policies, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is at a shocking 64%. Thus, dignified employment and livelihood opportunities remains a key challenge for persons with disabilities in India.\nPlatforms like Zomato offer flexible earning opportunities with minimal barriers to entry. At present, anyone with a PAN card, knowledge of using a smartphone and riding a two wheeler can undertake deliveries and onboard themselves with Zomato as a delivery partner.\nIn December 2022, Project ZEAL was launched (Zomato\u2019s Equitable Action for Livelihood) to explore if gig-based delivery work could offer livelihood opportunities for Persons with Disabilities. As on 31 March 2024, 400+ persons with locomotor disabilities, mostly wheelchair users, were onboarded on Zomato as delivery partners. These delivery partners have completed more than 6 lakh food delivery orders traveling over 15 lakh kms in 50 cities of India such as New Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Amritsar, Bhopal, Jaipur, Chandigarh, Agra and Lucknow.\nMaking the impossible possible: Through technology, commitment and sheer self-belief\nProject ZEAL was conceived in collaboration with \nNeomotion Assistive Solutions Private Limited\n, an IIT Madras incubated start-up that creates life transformative products for persons with locomotor disabilities and the elderly. They provide personalized wheelchairs \u2018NeoFly\u2019 as well as a motor-powered clip-on \u2018NeoBolt\u2019 which converts the NeoFly into a safe driving vehicle.\nWhile Neomotion\u2019s vehicles solved for the issue of mobility, Zomato also worked to reduce other barriers to entry including waiving onboarding fees, establishing a system to register wheelchairs separately and assigning wheelchair users only short-distance food order deliveries.\nIn addition, for every food order assigned to a wheelchair user, customers and restaurant partners are notified via the app that their delivery partner has special needs and are encouraged to lend a helping hand in handing over/ collecting their order from the delivery partner.\nWide-ranging impact\nInitially launched as a pilot, the scale and variety of impact from project ZEAL has completely surpassed expectations. Zomato engaged Pacta as its research partner to study the impacts of Project ZEAL from a multi stakeholder lens\nImpact on delivery partners\nImpact on finances: Enabling independence through earnings\nDue to scarce opportunities, persons with disabilities often resort to taking up earning opportunities that do not provide much stability or security. Associating with Zomato not only provides the opportunity to earn but working flexibly leaves room for rest and rejuvenation.\nWhen interviewed, many delivery partners expressed that:\nWorking as delivery partners has enabled them to earn after a long break or for the first time.\nZomato offered them a higher earning potential compared to the other opportunities available to them.\nThe instances of discrimination on grounds of their disability were very low.\nA delivery partner spoke about the shift in their life post onboarding with Zomato, \u201cNow I feel like I\u2019ve got a new life. Zomato has given me an opportunity where I can proudly talk about my earnings with family and friends.\nImpact on social life: From isolation and loneliness to friendships and communities\nFor ZEAL delivery partners, the opportunities for social interaction have increased multifold with both professional and personal benefits.\u00a0Delivering food comes with multiple stakeholder interactions \u2013 restaurants, customers and fellow delivery partners. These stakeholders often offer encouragement and support that makes ZEAL delivery partners feel seen and appreciated. The ability to step out of their homes motivates delivery partners to travel independently, engage and build a community of friends.\nImpact on both physical and mental wellbeing: A shift in the quality of life\nNeoMotion\u2019s customized wheelchairs allow for better physical comfort and lower strain, despite travel on bumpy roads. With their improved finances, ZEAL delivery partners are not only able to fulfill their basic needs but also go the extra mile in supporting their families. The increased social interactions have also helped partners fight loneliness and self doubt, harboring within these individuals for several years. With improved financial, health and social conditions, the overall quality of life for ZEAL delivery partners has seen an improvement.\nFiza\n, a ZEAL delivery partner from \nBangalore,\n who has challenged multiple stereotypes says \u201cI was not working before, this is my first working experience, it feels really good. Earlier I used to stay home and it impacted my mental health. I feel fresh and liberated as I step out. My mother often used to worry about my well-being, but I had the confidence and I tried onboarding with Zomato as a delivery partner. People are very supportive too. When customers see me, they encourage me to carry on my journey. I have stepped out after 11 years. I pay my own bills now.\u201d\nImpact on customers\nMany customers who have interacted with ZEAL delivery partners while collecting their food orders have expressed profound appreciation for the latter\u2019s resilience. Customers are surprised and often overwhelmed that their order has been delivered by someone with locomotor disability, overcoming both societal and infrastructural challenges. Many customers often take to social media to express their thoughts, and offer words of encouragement to ZEAL delivery partners. People on the streets appreciate, interact with and take photos with ZEAL delivery partners, making delivery partners feel seen and instilling a sense of achievement.\nThe project has helped break stereotypes about disability for customers. For many, it is the first time they have seen a person with disabilities as a contributing member of the workforce. Customer ratings, an indicator of customer satisfaction, are also high for ZEAL delivery partners \u2013 ranging between 4.5 to 5 stars.\nImpact on the ecosystem of organizations working on disability\nZomato and Neomotion\u2019s collaboration has galvanized the ecosystem of charitable organizations working across different aspects of disability, to directly and indirectly support livelihoods for persons with disabilities.\u00a0 Civil society organizations have come forward to provide grant funding to help individuals purchase the NeoMotion wheelchair, some provide accessible residential accommodation and developmental support to ZEAL delivery partners, and others provide coverage of their food and living expenses. Project ZEAL has helped to\u00a0 successfully unlock CSR and philanthropic funds for the cause of disability.\nLearnings and key challenges\nAllyship for new-onboards\nShortly after launching Project ZEAL, we realized that while many delivery partners had completed the onboarding process, they remained hesitant to start making deliveries. To address this challenge, we allowed new ZEAL delivery partners to shadow existing delivery partners, providing them with first hand experience and guidance. Additionally, we scheduled daily check-in and motivational calls from the Zomato team to offer support and encouragement to the new delivery partners, helping alleviate their concerns and boost their confidence.\nStakeholder sensitisation\nDisability sensitisation proved to be an integral part of establishing an inclusive environment for people with disabilities in our fleet. We learnt that the discomfort in interacting with people with disability is based on lack of knowledge and stereotypes. Internally, we organized sensitisation and awareness sessions for fleet coaches which enabled them to have healthier interactions with our ZEAL partners and understand their requirements better.\nAwareness and sensitisation of staff at restaurants and customers is equally important. We ensured both restaurants and customers were notified about the delivery partners\u2019 disability and encouraged them to extend their support to the delivery partners.\nAdvocacy for accessibility of built environment\nThe city-infrastructure that the delivery partners navigate has not been fully built from an inclusive perspective, making it additionally difficult for delivery partners to do what may be perceived as \u201cordinary\u201d. For greater inclusion we need to collectively advocate to make physical accessibility mandatory across our public and private infrastructure.\nDiversified funding sources required for inclusion\nFunding from government and domestic philanthropic sources remains a challenge in the disability sector. High quality assistive technologies today are far out of reach of people with limited means including millions of persons with disabilities. While the technology for Project ZEAL is currently funded by different charitable organizations and CSR funds, to achieve a scale, the goal is to be able to attract new sources of fundings/ finance for Project ZEAL.\nWay ahead\nZomato is committed to growing Project ZEAL to 1000 delivery partners by the end of 2024 and creating an inclusive last-mile deliveries ecosystem that welcomes and supports people with disabilities. We welcome enquiries from organizations that seek to learn from our journey or contribute to making it possible for more PwDs to get on boarded as delivery partners: ProjectZEAL@zomato.com\nIn March 2024, \nPacta\n, a law firm and policy think tank pursuing rigorous research on bridging gaps in implementation of laws and policy was engaged as a research partner to evaluate the one-year impact of Project ZEAL and identify pathways for scaling the participation of persons with disabilities in gig work. The above dialogue is an excerpt of PACTA\u2019s detailed analysis with multiple stakeholders. We extend our heartfelt appreciation to all the CSR partners and stakeholders for supporting this research and making Project ZEAL a success.\nhttps://www.nhfdc.nic.in/upload/nhfdc/Persons_Disabilities_31mar21.pdf\n \n\u21a9\ufe0e\nhttps://www.nhfdc.nic.in/upload/nhfdc/Persons_Disabilities_31mar21.pdf\n \n\u21a9\ufe0e"

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/zomatos-journey-to-seamless-ios-code-sharing-and-distribution/",
        "author": "Inder Deep Singh",
        "content": "History of Zomato\u2019s iOS apps\nMost of you are probably familiar with the Zomato consumer app \u2013 the one you use to order food, explore restaurants, dine out etc. But what you might not know is that we have a lot more apps which fall under Zomato\u2019s universe of iOS apps such as Blinkit, HyperPure, Zomato Restaurant Partner, Zomato Dining Partner etc. Initially it was easy to replicate things, over time it became evident that creating every app from scratch was inefficient and hard to manage especially when fundamental layers of an app were already in place. This is why all these apps share some part of the code originally written for the Zomato consumer app.\nDue to this need of code sharing, we structured our consumer code into various \u201cKits\u201d for each use case. For example, ZUIKit has the code required to use our UI components. All the sister apps would take a copy of the relevant kits, customise them to their requirements and ship their app. However, this approach resulted in teams using their own modified versions of the kits without a centralised syncing system. In other words, the ZUIKit used by the Blinkit app was different from the one used in the Zomato consumer app.\nInitially, this worked but whenever we needed the same behaviour across apps, we ended up manually copying and pasting the specific files then testing them in every app. This was highly inefficient and the issue compounded over time, as we found ourselves solving similar problems across multiple teams.\nOriginal project structure\nLet\u2019s break this down into two sections \u2013 internal kits & external dependencies.\nInternal kits\nThe kits we mentioned earlier, were all separate Xcode projects linked within the app. We simply shared copies of these Xcode projects with the teams that needed to integrate it into their app.\nNow, the obvious question arises: why not share xcframeworks instead of sharing the whole projects? Sharing xcframework would not solve the use case of the sister apps because the code within the kits was not very customizable as most of the code was written specifically for the Zomato consumer app.\nBefore starting the migration, we had 21 kits. For example, we had ZUIKit for UI elements, ZPaymentsKit for our payments flow, ZChatKit for chat/support flows, ZO2Kit for food ordering flows and so on.\nExternal dependencies\nWe were using Carthage to maintain external dependencies. Each kit had its own cartfiles, listing its dependencies. To streamline the process, we had a script in the root of the app\u2019s folder that fetched dependencies for all kits based on the folder structure.\nThe problem here was that Carthage was very hard to work with. For example, whenever we upgraded to the latest version of Xcode, we had to make sure that it\u2019s compatible with the Carthage dependencies. Wherever it was not, we had to fork the dependencies and make the necessary changes. Due to this verbose nature of using Carthage, people in the team perceived it as a black box which the platform team would take care of.\nThe problems of Carthage were not even just limited to dev workstations. We would face problems related to building the app on our GitHub Actions pipeline as well. We had an action which ran once per day to cache Carthage dependencies on our runner. This meant, in case you wanted to trigger a debug build with some other version of an external dependency, we would not be able to do it without rebuilding all the dependencies which would increase the build time significantly.\nDeciding the approach\nThere were multiple approaches that we could have taken. We could have continued using Carthage for external dependencies and importing internal kits. While this would solve the problems of code sharing & syncing, it would probably worsen the existing problems we faced with Carthage. We kept this as a last resort in case no other solution worked in our favour.\nIdeally, we wanted to use Apple\u2019s Swift Package Manager (SPM) for both internal kits and external dependencies. While SPM was relatively new to us and we hadn\u2019t explored it much before, we decided to give it a try before considering alternatives like Cocoapods. Spoiler alert, it worked.\nHence, we decided to convert our internal kits from Xcode projects to Swift Packages & alongside moved our external dependencies from Carthage to SPM as well.\nMigrating to swift package manager\nFirst kit migration\nWe started the migration from the bottom-most kit in our dependency tree, which happened to be Sushi. It is a relatively small kit written exclusively in Swift. This was an ideal case for creating a Swift Package so we simply ran the following command in Terminal within Sushi\u2019s folder:\nswift package init\nThis command creates the required files/directories for a Swift Package. After that, we just moved the files, and boom! Sushi was converted into a Swift Package. We were able to build it.\nIntegrating the first external dependency\nFrom there, we moved to the next kit with no internal dependencies, which was our API Manager. Here we had to get our first external dependency, Alamofire. This was fairly straightforward: we simply provided the URL of the GitHub repository of the dependency along with the desired version.\ndependencies: [\n    .package(url: \"https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire\", exact: \"5.4.4\")\n]\nWe could have chosen to specify the version in a range, but due to the large scale of our app, we decided to stick with the exact versions. This would prevent any unintended updates to dependency versions that could potentially cause issues for our end customers.\nFirst roadblock: Creating interdependent mixed source swift packages\nAlthough specifying the dependency was easy, we faced a major roadblock ahead. Our API Manager, like most of our other kits, has interdependent Swift & Objective-C code dependencies. However, SPM doesn\u2019t allow us to create mixed-source targets. Apple designed it this way because they consider Objective-C code to be legacy. So if you have mixed sources then it implies that your Swift code is dependent on Objective-C, creating a linear dependency graph.\nThe way to solve this issue is to create two separate targets in your package.\nObjective-C target which would only contain the Objective-C source files. This target would build on its own.\nSwift target which would only contain the Swift source files and depend on the Objective-C target.\n.target(\n    name: \"ApiManagerObjC\",\n    dependencies: [\"Alamofire\"],\n    path: \"ApiManager/ObjC\",\n    publicHeadersPath: \".\"\n),\n.target(\n    name: \"ApiManager\",\n    dependencies: [\"ApiManagerObjC\"],\n    path: \"ApiManager/Swift\"\n)\nThe package would expose a single library like below.\n.library(\n    name: \"ApiManager\",\n    targets: [\"ApiManager\"]\n)\nThis approach would not work for us because our Swift code depends on Objective-C and Objective-C also depends on Swift which creates a cyclic dependency.\nWe spent some time in identifying possible solutions for this issue, but didn\u2019t find any example where a Swift Package contained interdependent mixed source files. The common suggestion was to create an xcframework & then create a Swift Package which uses the xcframework instead of the source code. This works for closed source packages like Google Maps but distributing xcframeworks wasn\u2019t a solution for us.\nInitially, we thought that this might not be possible with the current implementation of Swift Package Manager and that we would have to explore this solution later once Apple solves this issue. Knowing how beneficial this migration would be, we decided not to give up. Just because no solution exists currently, doesn\u2019t mean the problem can\u2019t be solved.\nTo solve this problem, we decided to dive deep into Xcode internals to understand how it compiles a project. Here\u2019s a more technical breakdown of the process:\nXcode first compiles all Objective-C header files (.h) as they provide the necessary interface declarations required for other files.\nNext, Xcode compiles the Swift files (.swift) that depend only on the Objective-C header files. This step is possible because Swift can interoperate with Objective-C through bridging headers.\nAfter the Swift files, Xcode compiles the Objective-C implementation files (.m). These implementation files utilise both the previously compiled Objective-C header files and any public declarations from the Swift files.\nThis sequence ensures that dependencies are correctly resolved, allowing for successful compilation and linking of the project.\nWe realised that if we could separate our packages into these three targets, it might work. So, we organised our directory structure, which looked like this:\nKit/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 ObjC\nheaders/\n\u2502 \t\u251c\u2500\u2500 File1.h\n\u2502 \t\u251c\u2500\u2500 File2.h\n\u2502 \t\u2514\u2500\u2500 \u2026\nimplementations/\n\u2502 \t\u251c\u2500\u2500 File1.m\n\u2502 \t\u251c\u2500\u2500 File2.m\n\u2502 \t\u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Swift/\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 File1.swift\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 File2.swift\n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 \u2026\nWe then updated the target description in the Package.swift file as follows:\n.target(\n    name: \"ApiManagerObjC\",\n    dependencies: [\"Alamofire\"],\n    path: \"ObjC/headers\",\n    exclude: [\u201cimplementations\u201d],\n    publicHeadersPath: \".\"\n),\n.target(\n    name: \"ApiManagerSwift\",\n    dependencies: [\"ApiManagerObjC\"],\n    path: \"Swift\"\n),\n.target(\n    name: \"ApiManager\",\n    dependencies: [\"ApiManagerSwift\"],\n    path: \"ObjC/implementations\"\n)\nBy doing this, we were successfully able to build the ApiManager Swift Package, but we encountered an error `\n\u201cApiManagerObjc.o\u201d file was not found`\n while compiling the ApiManager Swift Package. The reason for this error is that an Objective-C target requires at least one .m file to generate a .o file. To resolve this, we created a new .m file named ApiManager.m in the headers folder and included the Foundation framework.\nLastly, we needed to add a header file in the implementation target to ensure successful compilation. We created an empty file named Header.h in the include directory within our implementation target\u2019s directory. In this header file, we simply imported the Objective-C target.\nOur updated file structure was as follows:\nKit/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 ObjC\n\u2502\theaders/\n\u2502 \t\u251c\u2500\u2500 File1.h\n\u2502 \t\u251c\u2500\u2500 File2.h\n\u2502 \t\u251c\u2500\u2500 KitObjC.m\n\u2502 \t\u2514\u2500\u2500 \u2026\n\u2502\timplementations/\n\u2502 \t\u251c\u2500\u2500 File1.m\n\u2502 \t\u251c\u2500\u2500 File2.m\n\u2502 \t\u251c\u2500\u2500 include/\n\u2502\t\t\u251c\u2500\u2500 Header.h\n\u2502 \t\u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Swift/\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 File1.swift\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 File2.swift\n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 \u2026\nAfter doing this, we were able to build our ApiManager Swift Package successfully.\nSecond roadblock: Resolving forward declarations\nOur approach worked for ApiManager but we soon hit our next roadblock while migrating ZUIKit. Some properties/functions defined in Objective-C header files were not accessible by our Swift target. The issue was we had declared properties of types defined in Swift in those header files by using forward declaration like below:\n@class SwiftObject;\n@property (nonatomic, strong) SwiftObject *property;\n- (void)setObject:(SwiftObject*)object;\nWe figured that a forward declaration gets resolved by the implementation of the header file. These properties/functions were accessible as expected in the implementation target. The issue was only limited to these properties/functions being accessed in the Swift target.\nOnce we understood the root cause of the problem, we began brainstorming a solution. We quickly realised that we needed to remove the forward declaration entirely from the header file. To achieve this, we also had to update the data type of the property and method argument/return type. But how could we do this without changing all the callers of these properties/functions? Here\u2019s how we updated the code:\nLegacyObject.h\n@property (nonatomic, strong) NSObject *propertyObj;\n- (void)setObject:(NSObject*)object;\nLegacyObject+.swift\nimport KitObjC;\n@objc public extension LegacyObject {\n    var property: SwiftObject? {\n        get { propertyObj as? SwiftObject }\n        set { propertyObj = newValue }\n    }\n}\nLegacyObject.m\n@import KitObjC;\n@import KitSwift;\n- (void)setObject:(NSObject*)object {\n    SwiftObject* obj = (SwiftObject*)object;\n    // use obj instead of object\n}\nWe replaced the type with the first available superclass of SwiftObject in Objective-C or NSObject. We updated the property name, then defined the property with the original name in a Swift extension which was just a computed property to get and set the Objective-C property. In case of functions, we typecast the expression inside the function body as we do have access to the type in the implementation target.\nNow that the solution was figured out, we repeated the migration process for all 21 of our kits. This process took a few weeks, all while feature developments were going on simultaneously as per our weekly release schedule. Consequently, we had to keep rebasing our changes on our development branch.\nFirst run\nA few weeks later, the entire app was in a buildable state. We hadn\u2019t tested our migrated kits in the app yet so running it for the first time felt like a big event. And, to our surprise, the app ran smoothly. At the first glance everything seemed to work, which was a big relief and our first glimpse of success in the migration process. Upon further testing, we found there were a few common patterns of bugs.\nThere were issues caused by the renaming of kit bundles leading to bugs in places where we were retrieving assets/files directly from the bundle using a bundle identifier. So updating those implementations solved this issue.\nThere were also few crashes due to using NSKeyedArchiver & NSKeyedUnarchiver. The issue was that the global names of classes had changed. For example, the class named ZUIKit.SwiftObject was renamed to ZUIKitSwift.SwiftObject. NSKeyedArchiver & NSKeyedUnarchiver use the name string which was used while archiving to unarchive the object. Since ZUIKit.SwiftObject no longer existed, unarchiving it resulted in a crash. We fixed this by updating the class names before archiving or unarchiving them using the code below.\nNSKeyedArchiver.setClassName(\u201cKit.SwiftObject\u201d, for: SwiftObject.self)\nNSKeyedUnarchiver.setClass(SwiftObject.self, forClassName: \u201dKit.SwiftObject\u201d)\nOnce these bugs were resolved, we were ready to merge the migrated code into our development branch. As a side benefit of migrating to Swift Package Manager, we no longer had to maintain multiple Xcode project files (one for each kit). We have a single project file for the app which eliminated a lot of broken file references and duplicate files stored on disk.\nThird roadblock: Fixing objective-C Code highlighting & completions\nBefore merging, we asked some team members to try working on the migrated branch and report any issues or anything we might have missed from a development perspective. Swift projects were working as expected, but there was an unusual issue with Objective-C projects. For some kits, the Objective-C code was not getting indexed in Xcode. Features like breakpoints, code completion, highlighting, and jump to definition were not working. This was a significant issue since some kits required frequent changes to the Objective-C code. Therefore, we needed to resolve this problem before merging the code.\nWhile researching, we learned that Xcode has a module called SourceKit for indexing code. We could access the logs generated by SourceKit in real time using the following command.\nEXPORT SOURCEKIT_LOGGING=3 && /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/MacOS/Xcode\nWhile checking these logs, we figured that the files were being indexed correctly with no errors from Sourcekit. This indicated that it was something related to Xcode. We then found that Xcode expects the header files to be in the same directory tree as the implementation files. So we updated the file structure and package description of one of the affected kits to test this.\nThe file structure was now as follows:\nKit/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 ObjC\n\u2502 \t\u251c\u2500\u2500 File1.m\n\u2502 \t\u251c\u2500\u2500 File2.m\n\u2502 \t\u251c\u2500\u2500 include/\n\u2502\t\t\u251c\u2500\u2500 Header.h\n\u2502\theaders/\n\u2502 \t\u251c\u2500\u2500 File1.h\n\u2502 \t\u251c\u2500\u2500 File2.h\n\u2502 \t\u251c\u2500\u2500 KitObjC.m\n\u2502 \t\u2514\u2500\u2500 \u2026\nThe target description in our Package.swift file would look something like this:\n.target(\n    name: \"ApiManagerObjC\",\n    dependencies: [\"Alamofire\"],\n    path: \"ObjC/headers\",\n    publicHeadersPath: \".\"\n),\n.target(\n    name: \"ApiManagerSwift\",\n    dependencies: [\"ApiManagerObjC\"],\n    path: \"Swift\"\n),\n.target(\n    name: \"ApiManager\",\n    dependencies: [\"ApiManagerSwift\"],\n    path: \"ObjC\",\n    exclude: [\"headers\"]\n)\nQuitting & relaunching Xcode after this change solved our issue. All the Objective-C files were now being indexed correctly and we were able to use all the features which were not working previously.\nFourth roadblock: App size increase\nNow that the app was working as expected and there were no development related issues, we were almost at the finish line. However, we wanted to see if the app binary size has changed due to our migration. That\u2019s when we faced another issue. Our app size had increased from around 60 MB to 400 MB. \nUpon analysing the app binary, we realised that most of our kits were getting linked statically in the executable rather than dynamically. Before migration, all of our kits were linked dynamically. The static linking caused the size increase, as many of our kits cross-reference the same underlying kits. This resulted in multiple copies of the same kits in the final executable binary.\nA Swift Package library can state its type as static or dynamic. If a library doesn\u2019t specify its type, the type is considered as automatic. In this case, Xcode decides the linking type at compile time based on the dependency graph of your project. Ideally, Xcode should detect the same kit used as a dependency in multiple kits and link it dynamically, but this didn\u2019t happen. The documentation states that Xcode prefers static linking but we couldn\u2019t get Xcode to link our dependencies dynamically. So, we specified the type as dynamic in all of our packages.\n.library(\n    name: \"ApiManager\",\n    type: .dynamic,\n    targets: [\"ApiManager\"]\n)\nThis reduced our app size back to its pre migration state. Another small issue we faced while testing our app in the Release configuration was that NSAssert added in Objective-C was still causing the app to crash. To fix it, we added a flag to our Objective-C implementation target. Our final target description looks like this:\n.target(\n    name: \"ApiManagerObjC\",\n    dependencies: [\"Alamofire\"],\n    path: \"ObjC/headers\",\n    publicHeadersPath: \".\"\n),\n.target(\n    name: \"ApiManagerSwift\",\n    dependencies: [\"ApiManagerObjC\"],\n    path: \"Swift\"\n),\n.target(\n    name: \"ApiManager\",\n    dependencies: [\"ApiManagerSwift\"],\n    path: \"ObjC\",\n    exclude: [\"headers\"],\n    cSettings: [\n        .define(\"NS_BLOCK_ASSERTIONS\", to: \"1\", .when(configuration: .release))\n    ]\n)\nAfter doing all of this, we shipped our first build using our migrated code in our app version 17.50.0. Our usage metrics remained unaffected, with crash free sessions stable at 99.99%. So outside of the iOS team, no one was aware that such a major architectural change had taken place in this release. This was a major win for us as we were able to entirely restructure the codebase of an app that is used by millions of people every single day without causing any negative impact.\nMigrating to a mono repo\nOnce we were confident in the success of our Swift package manager migration, we shifted our focus to moving all of our newly created Swift packages to a new central repository. We would call it \niOS Mono Repo\n and it would host readily available kits which could be plugged into any of our existing or upcoming sister apps. This would have been a straightforward thing to do but all 21 of our kits were not previously hosted on a single repository and we wanted to preserve git history for all files so as to not affect the day to day dev process.\nTo achieve this, we had to merge the histories of four repositories where our kits were previously hosted. There was a lot of Git magic involved, but nothing a few internet searches and a couple of cups of coffee couldn\u2019t fix. In the end, we got all 21 of our Swift Packages to the iOS Mono Repo with all their history intact.\nWe wanted the iOS Mono Repo to have a single Package.swift file at its root which would define all 21 libraries in one file. This would allow us to reference this repository from Xcode, specify a version and get access to all of our kits. However, we encountered a hurdle: Swift Package Manager doesn\u2019t allow remote packages to have local dependencies. Due to this, we had to scrap the idea of importing the iOS Mono Repo using Swift Package Manager in our app.\nInstead, we adopted an alternative approach by adding the iOS Mono Repo as a git submodule of the consumer app\u2019s repository. Now, every commit on the consumer app\u2019s repository would point to a commit of iOS Mono Repo with which it would build. Although this wasn\u2019t the ideal solution, it allowed us to proceed until Swift Package Manager supports a method for handling this use case. For the consumer app, this change mainly involved moving files around so we shipped it in the very next release, version 17.51.0.\nThis is where our bigger battle started. We now had to get all our sister apps to adopt this iOS Mono Repo. For newer apps or those with minimal changes to our original kits, This transition was straightforward, allowing us to migrate the Dining Merchant iOS app and the HyperPure iOS app without much hassle. The major challenge, however, was the Blinkit iOS app. The Blinkit iOS app was using versions of our kits which were about 1.5 years old and over time all the referenced kits had undergone numerous changes. Migrating the Blinkit app took us about 2-3 weeks, but it has now been successfully shipped to customers.\nOn to GitHub actions\nNo code migration is complete without ensuring everything runs smoothly. Since we were now merging code across two repositories on a day to day basis, we needed to add checks before a pull request was merged.\u00a0\nOn the consumer app\u2019s repository, we added a check to attempt building the code from the changes to be merged with the development branch of iOS mono repo. This would ensure no breaking change is merged to the Zomato consumer app\u2019s repository and that both the development branches always build together.\nOn the iOS Mono Repo, we wanted to ensure that all the Swift Packages inside the repository could be built with the proposed changes. This would have been super easy if we had a single Package.swift file at the root of the iOS Mono Repo to build all the kits which we, unfortunately, didn\u2019t have as we were unable to use Swift Package Manager to import iOS Mono Repo into our app. One way was to have that file anyway and someone would have to update it every time some package is added or removed from the iOS Mono Repo. Since the file would not be used by anyone in day to day development, ensuring the changes would not be easy. To combat this, we wrote a Swift script to generate the Package.swift file based on the contents of iOS Mono Repo. We kept that Swift file at the root of the iOS Mono Repo. Before merging every pull-request, a check runs this script and then tries to build the iOS Mono Repo Package. The pull-request can only be merged if the checks are succeeded. This ensures that the development branch of iOS Mono Repo always builds.\nRoad ahead\nNow that our project structure is up to date, we have a streamlined way to ship kits to multiple apps. All this migration made it super easy to update to Xcode 15 as well. All we had to do was to just open the project and that\u2019s it. We have already merged our first Swift Macro to the iOS Mono Repo which will improve the development cycle for all iOS developers at Zomato.\nNext up, we have to break our kits down into smaller pieces and write new kits designed for use across multiple apps. With all this code flowing across apps, testing also becomes crucial. We now need to make our kits and apps more testable to ensure no business logic breaks when updating the kits. You will hear more about the developments in these areas in our upcoming blog posts.\nOverall, this migration significantly elevates how we develop for Apple platforms as a whole. As we embrace these advancements, we\u2019re excited to unlock new possibilities and set a higher standard for innovation. Exciting times ahead!\nIf solving these kinds of problems is something that excites you, and you feel like you have the required skills, write to us at \nios@zomato.com"

        "content": "Menu is one of the most important elements that defines a restaurant. Most restaurants tend to spend a disproportionate time creating a winning menu. In interactions with our restaurant partners as well, some questions we frequently hear are: \n\u201cHow do I make my menu more attractive? What changes can I make to my menu to improve orders from customers?\u201d\nHence, we have now compiled the best practices to help restaurant partners build an effective menu that appeals to new customers, help get better conversion, and help improve average order values.\nA good menu is visually appealing, easy to navigate and communicates the right value. \nThe menu should ideally have high quality dish images, with accurate descriptions, justifiable prices charged by the restaurant partners and be one that is not too long or too repetitive. We recognize that each restaurant is unique and so are its challenges and accordingly this tool has been designed to help each of our restaurant partners with personalized recommendations. Our goal is to empower restaurant partners with the knowledge to make informed decisions that could drive growth. Menu Score helps restaurant partners to convert their menu by drilling down into three key areas:\nMenu Appeal: Visual Delight and Clarity\nThe first impression is visual: dish photos, descriptions and item classifications. Menu score evaluates the completeness of the menu, analyzing elements such as photos, descriptions, add-ons, and side dishes. Engaging photos and clear descriptions not only captivate customers but also influence their decision-making process.\nMenu Browsability: Navigating Success\nMenu score evaluates the number of items, identifies repeated items, and highlights items not being ordered and guides the restaurant partners in streamlining the menu to enhance customer satisfaction and encourage more orders.\nMenu Pricing: Capturing & Creating Value\nPricing correctly is an art, and the optimal price charged by the restaurants can often determine a dish\u2019s success. The menu score provides information about how many potential customers dropped off from the outlet after preparing a cart, which provides an insight to restaurant partners to accordingly decide their prices.\nThe Menu Score Advantage\nSo, what sets Menu Score apart? It\u2019s not just about analytics; it is about personalized, actionable insights. Here\u2019s what you can expect:\nCustomized Recommendations: \nReceive tailored suggestions for improving menu completeness and navigability. \nReal-time Updates:\n Keep the menu dynamic with real-time updates based on changing customer preferences and market trends like Navratri or New Year.\nMenu Score isn\u2019t just a tool; it is a restaurant\u2019s secret mantra for food and delivery ordering success which aims at providing the restaurant partners a higher menu score correlating with a higher menu to cart ratio. It analyzes the menu, pinpoints areas to improve, and unlocks a restaurant\u2019s true growth potential.\u00a0\nSo now, say goodbye to guesswork and say hello to Menu Score!\u00a0\nLet\u2019s embark on this journey together towards culinary excellence and business prosperity.\nAll our restaurant partners can access their menu score using \nour merchant dashboard\n.\u00a0\nBon App\u00e9tit,\nTeam Zomato"

        "content": "At Zomato, our tech teams are always working towards creating innovative solutions and ensuring we have adequate security measures in place that uphold them. This commitment led us to recently organize an event, \u2018Capture The Flag\u2019 (CTF), that was aimed at teaching security concepts to our developers in a practical and fun way. Taking learnings from our internal security audits and our active \nbug bounty program\n, it became evident that for building robust applications, developers required a thorough grasp of frequently encountered security weaknesses and that is why we created Hackoween \u2013 a security hackathon.\nLet\u2019s take you on a journey of how we achieved making security learning all this practical and fun!\nCrafting challenges for all\nWe had a lineup of 16 challenges with various sub-challenges that aimed to cater to different skill levels. Our goal was to make sure everyone, from beginners to CTF experts, had something valuable and challenging to tackle. Through this, we educated them on critical security concepts in an engaging, competitive manner, making learning interactive for all participants.\nLet\u2019s go through a few challenges that stood out in the entire 48 hour event, each inspired by security vulnerabilities found in our internal application security audits.\nRace 2 Finale: The race condition\nObjective: This challenge shed light on a common oversight \u2014 the reliance on rate limiting without the implementation of locks to prevent the execution of concurrent requests. Here, we invited participants to exploit the OTP rate limit via a race condition attack.\nVaccine good or bad: SQL injection challenge\nObjective: The task was to exploit SQL injection vulnerability to extract the CTF flag. This challenge was a stark reminder of the persistent threat posed by SQL injection attacks, emphasizing the critical need for implementing secure coding practices via parameterized queries and thorough validation of all user inputs.\nNo such thing as free lunch: Price manipulation challenge\nThis challenge was about a common bug \u2013 parameter tampering within shopping carts.\u00a0 Participants had to identify and manipulate payment amounts to pay only \u20b91 for a \u20b9500 product, demonstrating the importance of server-side validation and not solely relying on the user input.\nAlso, to further enrich the CTF experience, we introduced a dedicated section for Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) challenges. These puzzles were focussed on the art of gathering information from publicly available sources and were designed to be engaging and fun. By balancing the technical challenges with the investigative nature of OSINT puzzles, we aimed to provide a holistic cybersecurity experience.\nLet\u2019s explore some of the challenges that were part of the CTF.\nOSINT Aircraft Surveillance\n: This challenge required participants to use their detective skills to gather information from public sources. Similar challenges were inspired by a common OSINT technique for \naircraft surveillance\n, wherein flight data is publicly accessible, allowing one to track metadata for a specific aircraft.\nGEOINT\n: Under the OSINT category, geolocation challenges are like playing a strategic game \u00a0of \u201cGeoGuessr\u201d. The task at hand utilizes a prevalent GEOINT technique, requiring participants to deduce the geographic location from visual cues in an image. In the illustration below, The display of \u201cHOSTINEC\u201d and \u201cSARIS\u201d signs indicates a central european linguistic region. Further translating the word HOSTINEC would yield that it is the Czech word for hotel, guesthouse etc, narrowing the result down to Czech Republic. This technique is commonly used in various government agencies to track location.\nHow can you build your CTF challenge platform like ours?\nTo host this event, we built a Ruby on Rails web application, specifically tailored for managing the CTF challenges and flags. Inspired by the open-source platform \nCTFd\n, our system provided a seamless experience for participants, with features like score visibility control, user-team management and Single Sign-On (SSO) login.\nIn order to safely replicate SQL injection attacks, we used a read-only SQLite database to prevent accidental writes and confine injection vulnerabilities within a sandbox. Demonstrating the credential leak scenario securely, we leveraged \ncanary tokens\n instead of real credentials. This mitigated the risk of actual token abuse while still providing a realistic and educational experience. We used separate infrastructure isolated from the production environment for provisioning resources and to safeguard against potential unknown exploitation.\nLet\u2019s take you through the exciting D-Day\nAs teams gathered at the venue, the event kicked off with a briefing about Hackoween \u2013 what it was, highlighting the significance of security and setting the stage for 48 hours of intensive learning. The initial session was important, aligning the entire tech team\u2019s focus on seeing this event as a learning opportunity rather than just a hackathon to be won.\nAs the competition commenced, the atmosphere shifted to one of intense determination. The initial tasks were designed to introduce participants into the CTF mindset, teaching them to recognize and submit flags, a crucial skill in accumulating game points and advancing in the competition.\nTrue to Zomato\u2019s spirit of creating memorable experiences, participants were treated to a range of refreshments like red bulls and pizzas, to keep their energy levels high for the thrilling hacking sessions ahead.\nWatch the excitement unfold with us\n48 hours flew by as tech teams burned the midnight oil to tackle these challenges. With all 245 participants forming 65 dynamic teams, the event was nothing short of spectacular.\nWhile several teams were racing closely towards the finish line, two teams surged ahead in the final stretch, tackling the toughest set of challenges to emerge victorious.\n1st Place: Ginyu Force \n\ud83e\udd47\nTeam Members: \nDeepak Verma\n, \nSaurabh Sabharwal\n, \nSameer Saxena\n, \nGirish Kumar\n, \nAyush Chauhan\nPrize: Each member received an iPad Air\n2nd Place: Mishra ji ki team\n \ud83e\udd48\nTeam Members: Aniket Suri, \nAniket Verma\n, \nRam Singla\n, \nRajat Taya\n, \nArpit Mishra\nPrize: Each member received a Kindle reader\nAll the teams that persevered until the end demonstrated an unwavering fighting spirit and a resolve to win.

        "content": "The Magnitude of New Year\u2019s Eve\nOn this day, every second counts, and every order is a celebration. This year, we didn\u2019t just surpass expectations; we \nredefined\n them.\nOn the technical front, our observability platform adeptly handled \n2.2 billion active time series\n metrics, reaching a peak throughput of \n17.8 million per second\n, showcasing robust performance during peak demand periods. Customers placed \nabout 2 million orders\n from new restaurants they explored, highlighting adventurous palates and a vast variety of options on Zomato.\nOn the data front, \nLogStore\n \n\u2013\n \nour in-house logging platform\n processed \n60 TB application logs on that day, with an 80 million RPM peak ingestion rate\n. Kafka, the backbone of our event-driven architecture, efficiently handled a remarkable rate of \n450+ million messages per minute, \nwith the clusters achieving a total peak throughput of \n5.6 GBps\n.\nEven with the unprecedented demand of New Year\u2019s Day, 60% of the orders were successfully \ndelivered\n \nwithin 30 minutes\n.\n \nOur chat support handled a record \n19,500 peak concurrent sessions\n and about \n51,400 messages were exchanged per minute\n, ensuring swift and effective customer service.\u00a0\nPrelude to the Big Night: The Preparation\nAt Zomato, preparation for NYE is a blend of tech and strategy, setting a benchmark for best practices for ourselves and the industry. We delve deep into each service, ensuring that every aspect is finely tuned for peak performance. Special focus is placed on kill switch reviews, ensuring fail-safes for every scenario. Our preparation includes:\nService Design Review\n: We revisit service design from the ground up, removing excess redundancies to reduce latency and enhance performance.\nDatabase Optimization\n: Monitoring of database metrics helps identify bottlenecks. Slow queries are optimized, and the database load is reduced by caching frequently used queries.\nIncident Analysis\n: Past incidents are meticulously reviewed for actionable insights, ensuring all loops are closed.\nAdherence to Best Practices\n: Each service is aligned with organizational best practices.\nEnhanced Monitoring\n: Any gaps in monitoring are filled to aid quicker debugging during incidents.\nAlerts and Anomalies\n: Frequent alerts are reviewed, and root cause analyses are conducted. New alerts are added to identify early signs of potential issues.\nKill Switches and Degraded Modes\n: To prevent lower-tier dependencies from impacting critical services, kill switches are implemented, including modes for degraded operations to maintain core business functions.\nHowever, the cornerstone of our preparation is chaos testing and benchmarking.\nChaos-testing: \nAn approach to test a system\u2019s integrity by simulating and injecting fault into the system. We understand that despite exhaustive reviews, surprises can lurk in the system. Imagine a seemingly minor service causing major disruptions \u2013 this is where chaos testing becomes invaluable. It helps us to uncover hidden dependencies and potential failure points in our complex microservices architecture. We simulate extreme conditions such as:\nUpstream downtime by injecting unrealistically high response times via our internal service mesh layer built using \nKuma\nActivation of kill switches to trigger degraded mode, testing system sanity\nCache miss injections to evaluate database reliability under stress\nBenchmarking\n: The adage \n\u201c\nAt scale, everything breaks\n\u201d is not just a cautionary statement, but a fundamental principle that guides our approach to system reliability. As we scale up to meet the massive surge in orders and customer interactions during NYE, hidden vulnerabilities and bottlenecks in our system that are not apparent during regular operations may emerge. These can range from database performance issues, network bottlenecks, to unforeseen failures in microservices that behave differently under heavy load. \nThis is particularly crucial when preparing for events like NYE, where the sheer volume of transactions pushes our systems to their limits. Benchmarking provides insights into how they would behave under the extreme pressures of a high-traffic event like NYE.\nBenchmarking, especially across our 300+ microservices, presented a unique challenge. Our goal was to push our systems to their limits while ensuring zero negative impact on our operations. To navigate this delicate balance, our SRE team (Site Reliability Engineering) developed an \nin-house Benchmarking Platform\n (more on this in a subsequent blog) tailored to these unique challenges. Our approach included:\nMaintaining data integrity by focusing on read-only traffic or ensuring safe write operations\nIsolated benchmarking to prevent simultaneous stress on interrelated systems\nIsolation from production workloads. The benchmarking setup is completely independent to prevent any adverse effects on production loads\nGradual increase in load to allow sufficient time for effective autoscaling\nAutomated and systematic benchmarking to reduce manual effort and ensure timely benchmarking of a large number of microservices\nSafe practices such as aborting benchmarking automatically if any critical alerts are triggered or reducing benchmarking load if the error rate on upstream increases\nThe results of this intensive preparation were remarkable. We clocked a total of \n14,000 minutes of benchmarking \nacross over 100 services, achieving a peak throughput of \n50 million requests per minute\n, with over \n30 billion requests\n being fired during the benchmarking phase. This extensive exercise, storing around\n 400 TB\n of benchmarking requests, provided us with invaluable insights and actionable data, all achieved without a \nsingle\n service outage.\nD-Day: Breaking Records, Setting Benchmarks\nOn NYE, Zomato\u2019s war rooms, spanning multiple businesses, were buzzing with energy as teams from every department came together to monitor services closely. The overall atmosphere was charged, reflecting a day where every aspect comes together in a coordinated, tech-driven effort. The SRE team proactively prescaled the infrastructure to handle the expected surge. We deployed an impressive array of EC2 fleets spanning across \n11,000 EC2 instances\n. This was enough to host our massive armada of ECS services consisting of ~\n40,000\n \nECS tasks\n driving our operations forward. Large screens on every floor in the office displayed performance indicators, keeping the team alert and responsive.\u00a0\nHere is what \nRaunak Kondiboyina\n from the Serviceability team had to say about the energy of 31st December at the Zomato office \u2013\n \u201cThis was my 4th NYE at Zomato. Compared to last year, this year I was feeling pretty relaxed. Most of this confidence was because we started preparing early, and all review processes and benchmarking helped the team gain more confidence.\u201d\u00a0\nManuj Grover \nfrom the Time-service team, shared his emotions for the D-day here \u2013 \u201c\nIt was D-Day, the excitement and anticipation was palpable. It was a mix of nervousness and thrill as we prepared for the highest order volume of the year. The sleepless nights and long hours leading up to the day were fueled by a sense of purpose and determination to ensure everything ran smoothly.\u201d\nAs NYE descended, energy in Zomato\u2019s war rooms accelerated to match the festive fervor in India. Activity on our app surged as the order rate skyrocketed to \n8400 orders per minute\n. Our systems were operating behind a tsunami of digital traffic at a peak of \n80.92 million requests per minute.\nWe use ElastiCache for our caching needs, on NYE we scaled up our ElastiCache clusters to reach a hefty total of \n35 TB in memory \nacross all our microservices. At peak, this fleet saw a significant \n20 Gbps \nof network throughput, managing \n1 billion GET operations \nand around\n 100 million SET operations per minute\n, demonstrating the sheer scale of our data handling capabilities.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe rely on a mix of DynamoDB, Aurora RDS and MongoDB as our primary databases. DynamoDB usage peaked with \n12.3 million RCUs and 5.2 million WCUs consumed per minute\n, while our RDS clusters were pushed to their limits handling a scale of \n610k select queries and 16,000 write transactions per second\n. MongoDB clusters aggregated read throughput peaked at \n470,000 ops/s scanning 3.3 million docs per second\n while the write throughput peaked at \n180,000 ops/s writing over 1.75 million docs per second\n.\nStorage provisioning was no less formidable, on New Year\u2019s Eve, we provisioned a total of \n5.5 petabytes\n across our infrastructure.\nCompared to previous years, we saw a monumental shift in scale and efficiency. While India celebrated New Year\u2019s Eve, our order metrics climbed to unprecedented heights, mirroring the exhilarating atmosphere in our war rooms, and peaked at the moment when we hit the \n3 million orders\n mark, a milestone that not only signified our operational success but also underscored the trust placed in us by millions of customers.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s what \nAngad Sharma\n from the Search team had to say about D-Day energy \u2013 \n\u201cZomato office during NYE was bubbling with energy, a sweet kind of chaos but a confident & prudent calm like we had everything under control, and no external power can waiver our resolve & pledge for resiliency.\u201d\nPost NYE Reflections: Zomato\u2019s Ongoing Mission of Excellence, Innovation, and Continuous Learning\nWhile our New Year\u2019s Eve experience has definitely become a springboard for future growth, we also know that we have a lot more to do.\nIt takes curiosity to learn and unlearn, and as a young Engineering team \u2013 with an average age of just 25 years \u2013 we already bring the spirit of immense interest and question to work every day. We believe we will hit new milestones this year, and are focused on working towards enhancing Zomato\u2019s ordering and delivery journey at every step of the way.\nOur goal for 2024? We want to build for the \nhappiest customer experience\n, and not just a solve to a problem. And in this pursuit, we are bound to make some mistakes, and would have to face many new challenges \u2013 but we will surely get more things right than wrong \ud83d\ude42\nAs always, we\u2019re just\n 1% done\n."

        "content": "Zomato, India\u2019s food ordering and delivery platform, that lists more than 2,00,000 restaurants, is emerging as the leading market player in India\u2019s food tech industry. As the demand for online food ordering continues to grow, Zomato recognizes the importance of innovation in meeting scalability requirements.\nConsidering the nature of the business, customer traffic is primarily concentrated during meal times, leading to notable differences in workload between peak and non-peak hours. Additionally, on special occasions like Diwali and New Year\u2019s Eve, Zomato experiences massive traffic surges with significantly higher spikes compared to regular days. Therefore, it\u2019s crucial for Zomato to select a database that ensures consistent low latency, regardless of scale, and possesses the capability to handle traffic spikes without the need for expensive overprovisioning during periods of lower activity.\nIn this post, we explain the primary factors that prompted Zomato to transition away from relational databases and TiDB to \nAmazon DynamoDB\n, a fully managed, serverless, key-value NoSQL database. This enabled us to effectively manage traffic spikes without the need for costly overprovisioning during periods of reduced activity and even lower total cost of ownership (TCO).\nZomato\u2019s Billing Platform\nZomato\u2019s Billing Platform is accountable for managing post-order processes, primarily focusing on maintaining ledgers and handling payouts for various business verticals such as Food delivery, Dining Out, Blinkit and Hyperpure.\u00a0 It also maintains ledgers and handles payouts for Feeding India, a Zomato give-back.\nThis platform effectively handles the distribution of payments to restaurant partners and riders at a large scale and processes around 10 million events on a typical day. This results in approximately 1 million payments on a weekly basis. Because generating invoices and processing payments is a mission-critical function for Zomato, the availability and resiliency of the billing system is important for the success of its business.\nThe Zomato Billing Platform architecture follows an asynchronous messaging approach using Kafka for integrating independent microservices in a loosely coupled manner to operate at scale and evolve independently and flexibly. The platform acts as both producers and consumers of kafka events consuming billing order, processing it and producing processed ledger for various business use cases. The following diagram illustrates the legacy architecture.\nZomato Billing Platform used TiDB, an open source distributed SQL database that supports online transaction processing (OLTP) and online analytical processing (OLAP) workloads. It combines the scalability of NoSQL databases with the ACID compliance of traditional relational databases. Its distributed architecture enables horizontal scalability, fault tolerance, and high availability. The TiDB system comprises multiple components that communicate with each other to form a complete system.\nThe following key components of the TiDB system need to be maintained:\nTiDB server \u2013 \nThe TiDB server serves as a stateless SQL layer, providing external access through the MySQL protocol. It can be scaled horizontally and offers a unified interface through load balancing components.\nPlacement Driver server \u2013 \nThe Placement Driver (PD) server manages metadata and data scheduling commands within the cluster. It acts as the brain of the cluster by storing metadata and dynamically assigning data distribution tasks to TiKV nodes based on real-time reports.\nTiKV server \u2013 \nThe TiKV server is responsible for distributed data storage and functions as a transactional key-value storage engine.\nTiFlash server \u2013 \nThe TiFlash server is a specialized columnar storage server optimized for fast analytical processing, storing data in columns for improved performance.\nChallenges with the original design\u00a0\nZomato initially incorporated TiDB into the original design to manage its OLTP workloads. The decision to use TiDB was based on the expertise of Zomato\u2019s engineering team in the relational model and MySQL, as well as its ability to horizontally scale and meet scaling needs.\nOver the years, the scale at which Zomato operates has grown tremendously, and with the addition of Blinkit and HyperPure, we also needed our billing platform to be multi-tenant. We faced several challenges while scaling and maintaining our TiDB database:\nAs our operations expanded, we faced challenges in handling schema changes and observed a decline in query performance, particularly in larger tables with billions of rows and terabytes of data. Furthermore, performance issues arose with certain workloads involved subqueries or joining numerous tables.\nThe distributed nature of TiDB introduced additional complexity compared to single-node databases. One such example is adding nodes with larger storage capacity to a balanced cluster for scalability. This resulted in the designated node becoming the primary for write operations, leading to higher CPU usage and negatively impacting the overall performance of the service. This, in turn, led to poor service level agreements (SLAs), a compromised customer experience, and delayed payments.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe expanded our cluster size from 5 nodes to 25 nodes in both the primary and replica clusters to accommodate the growing scale and data. Additionally, during peak days with anticipated high traffic, the infrastructure was manually scaled up and kept overprovisioned to prevent performance issues. All this led to an increase in TCO and made it a less scalable solution.\nWe opted for TiDB when their cloud solutions were not available. Because the TiDB database was self-managed, our team took on the majority of heavy lifting to ensure its reliable operation. This included tasks like synchronizing replicas, monitoring storage, adding extra nodes, and backup management. Migrating to newer versions also required tremendous effort and time, and combined all these over time this became an overhead for our teams.\nAs the size of the database grew, the backup tasks experienced longer completion times due to the larger volume of data being processed. This added delay in the overall backup process has led to a situation where we were unable to meet our agreed SLAs.\nWhy DynamoDB\nDynamoDB is a serverless, NoSQL, fully managed database service with single-digit millisecond response times at any scale, enabling you to develop and run modern applications while only paying for what you use.\nApart from the fact that we are already using DynamoDB for multiple business-critical services at Zomato, the following functionalities highlight the key features of DynamoDB that increase scalability, streamline developer productivity, reduce time spent on repetitive tasks, and lower our overall TCO:\nDynamoDB maintains consistent performance as your application scales, ensuring that regardless of the database size or number of concurrent queries, all operations will have a reliable response time in the order of milliseconds.\nAs a general rule for data modeling, related data is kept together. Therefore, DynamoDB doesn\u2019t need a query planner to parse a query into a multi-step process to read, join, and aggregate data from different places on disk. This enables DynamoDB to support low-latency lookup and makes queries efficient with growing scale. It also frees developers and DBAs from the responsibility of performance tuning because you no longer need to spend time debugging query plans or figuring out why query performance decreases at scale.\nDynamoDB offers an \nauto scaling capacity\n feature that can modify our database resources (provisioned throughput capacity) according to user traffic. This helps us scale for sudden spikes in traffic and not over-provision for peak workloads compared to TiDB\u2014all while maintaining consistent latencies in an efficient and cost-effective manner.\nUnlike TiDB, DynamoDB eliminates the need for manual setup and management tasks. It is serverless, meaning you don\u2019t have to handle hardware provisioning, configuration, replication, software patching, database backup, or cluster scaling yourself.\nSolution Overview\nTo address the aforementioned problems, the Zomato team identified the need to redesign the data storage layer. After conducting a thorough evaluation of various databases, the engineering team decided to use DynamoDB. This section highlights the key points that guided our approach.\nSingle table design\nIn the original TiDB design, we followed the traditional relational database management system (RDBMS) approach. Each table was dedicated to storing data for a particular entity and had a unique key that connected to a foreign key in another table. To retrieve data from related tables and present results in a unified view, a JOIN operation involving multiple tables was performed. For example, we had separate sets of tables for each business vertical, which contained entities like payout_details, billing_ledger, payout_order_mapping, and billing_breakup, as illustrated in the following figure.\nGiven our learnings of using DynamoDB for multiple microservices, we decided to streamline this relational schema into a unified DynamoDB table using the \nadjacency list\n design pattern that encompasses all businesses and stores data for various entities. This strategy effectively consolidated related data into a single table (see the following figure), enhancing performance by eliminating the need to fetch data from different locations on disk. It also reduced costs, especially for read operations, because a single read operation now retrieves all the required data instead of multiple queries for different entities.\nDesigning partition keys\nIn DynamoDB, data is \ndistributed across partitions\n, which are physical storage units. Each table can have multiple partitions, and in most cases the partition key determines where the data is stored. For tables with composite primary keys, the sort key may be used as a partition boundary. DynamoDB splits partitions by sort key if the collection size grows bigger than 10 GB. Designing a schema and identifying the partition key is crucial for efficient data access. Imbalances in data access can lead to \nhot partitions\n, where one partition experiences a higher workload, causing throttling and inefficient use of I/O capacity.\nWe tackled this problem by incorporating the partition key with composite attributes, allowing for data distribution across multiple partitions. The partition key for the single table was constructed by combining the merchant ID, payout cycle, and business vertical, with each element separated by a separator. For our workload, this approach improved the cardinality of the partition key and ensured that the read and write operations are distributed as evenly as possible across tables, avoiding poor performance.\nIn addition, we utilized the inverted index method to query data. This \nsecondary index\n design pattern is commonly used with DynamoDB. This allows for querying the other side of a many-to-many relationship, which is typically not feasible in a standard key-value store approach.\nSimilar to the primary table\u2019s partition key, it is essential to guarantee an even distribution of read and write operations across partitions for the partition key of a global secondary index (GSI) to prevent throttling. This was achieved by introducing a number, referred to as the \ndivision number\n (based on a business logic), along with the index key. As a result, the updated GSI format is now represented as <index-key>_<division-number>.\nMigration approach\nWe wanted a seamless transition from TiDB to DynamoDB with zero downtime and no disruption to ongoing operations. To achieve this, we undertook a phased approach with strategies such as dual write, replication, data synchronization, and failover mechanisms to ensure continuous availability of our data during the migration process.\nThe following diagram illustrates the details of each phase.\nThis approach allowed Zomato to maintain uninterrupted access to their critical information, ensuring smooth operations and minimizing any negative impact on productivity or customer experience.\nMigration Results | Performance\nThe decision to switch from TiDB to DynamoDB was primarily driven with the objective of enhancing the application\u2019s performance and reducing operational complexity. The performance improvement depicted in the following figure demonstrates an average decrease of 90% in microservice response time. Another noteworthy observation is that regardless of the level of traffic, the response time of the microservice consistently remains around 75 milliseconds.\nScalability\nThe performance of the database layer in the earlier architecture became a significant bottleneck, resulting in the microservice achieving a throughput of only 2,000 requests per minute (see the following figure). It was essential to address this limitation in the database layer to enhance the microservice\u2019s throughput and overall performance and to meet Zomato\u2019s scalability requirements.\nFollowing the migration to DynamoDB, the performance of the database significantly improved, successfully addressing the bottleneck at the database level. Consequently, with the current scale, the throughput of the microservice increased to 8,000 RPM, allowing Zomato to handle four times more traffic compared to the previous design. The enhanced throughput led to reduced lag and near-real-time billing, resulting in improved SLAs.\nCost\nIn the new solution with DynamoDB, we pay only for what we use, unlike the previous approach with TiDB, which involved over-provisioning the database for sudden traffic peaks. As a result, our billing system\u2019s monthly expenses saw a notable 50% reduction due to these changes.\nA Better User Experience\nThe migration from TiDB to DynamoDB has enhanced our overall reporting times, empowering us to make better day-to-day decisions. Additionally, it has optimized the response time for merchants\u2019 statements of accounts, improving the user experience and meeting SLAs across all stakeholders.\nThis blog was authored by \nKanica Mandhania\n and \nNeha Gupta\n under the guidance of \nHimanshu Rathore\n. The migration was carried out by the Central billing team including \nShailendra Kumar\n, \nSushrut Bhatele\n, \nShreyas Raj\n, \nVikas Kumar\n under the mentorship of \nGyanendra Kumar."

        "content": "Imagine scrolling through your favorite food ordering and delivery app, Zomato. Suddenly, a stunning picture of a dish appears. It\u2019s not just a snapshot; it\u2019s a picture-perfect masterpiece that tells you exactly what you will be getting and makes your taste buds tingle!\u00a0\nAt Zomato, we understand the power of good food pictures. It is important for food and beverage pictures displayed on a restaurant partner\u2019s menu to be shot at the right angles, zoom levels, and backgrounds for them to be appealing to the customers. Every day, we receive an incredible 10,000+ food photos from our restaurant partners, many taken directly on their mobile phones. However, not all photos meet the quality standards and we believe that good quality photos are crucial in helping customers decide what to order.\nThis led us to a question: how can we empower our restaurant partners to capture professional-quality photos without requiring Zedi-level photography skills or expensive equipment?\nEnter PicNic AI (Picture Nicely AI), our culinary maestro of image enhancement. We asked ourselves, \n\u201cCan we help our restaurant partners to benefit from the power of AI by elevating their basic food pictures into something that was shot by a photographer in a studio using a professional camera?\n\u201d The answer was a resounding YES! We wanted every dish, whether from your cozy neighborhood joint or that five-star restaurant up the hill, to look so irresistible that you would want to devour it on the spot. And that\u2019s where Zomato\u2019s innovative ML team began on a journey to build PicNic AI.\nDeveloping PicNic AI\nTo bring our vision to life, our team turned to an AI model called Stable Diffusion. Stable Diffusion is a generative AI model that excels at transforming input signals into stunning images. It combines the power of deep learning with advanced Diffusion Generative AI to produce visually appealing and realistic results using a text prompt that describes how the produced image looks. However, to truly showcase the original dish uploaded by the restaurant, we needed the InPainting Variant of Stable Diffusion.\nThe InPainting Variant of Stable Diffusion allows us to seamlessly integrate the original dish into a professionally enhanced background. It also enables us to further control and guide the image generation process by providing an image mask that instructs the model to alter and generate only certain portions of the image while leaving the other portions untouched.\u00a0\nThe model goes beyond merely generating the background; It also completes any cropped portions, fixing zooming inconsistencies, adjusting color balance, and even upscaling the image to higher resolutions.\nGuiding the Magic: Image Mask and Text Prompts\nThe process begins with the original image uploaded by the restaurant partner. We then pass it through our proprietary Zomato Segmentation AI Model, which skillfully detects and labels the food and dish from the\u00a0 background. No need to label various objects or classes here; this model specializes in understanding the generic foreground using a custom Saliency Object Detection model capable of adapting to the vast universe of cuisines, regions and dishes that grace Zomato\u2019s platform.\nBut what about the artistic flair? That\u2019s where the Text Prompts come into play. These prompts are carefully crafted instructions that describe the desired style, aesthetics, and technical aspects of the background of the dish. By providing this guidance to Stable Diffusion, we ensure that the resulting image is a visual masterpiece that captures the original dish and sets the stage for a delightful food ordering and delivery experience.\nServing Up Success:\nThanks to the artistry of PicNic AI, over 1 lakh images uploaded by our restaurant partners every month have benefited from this. This technology makes professional-quality food pictures accessible for our restaurant partners even in the remotest areas of the country at no additional cost and through more visually appealing images. A win-win for our 3 lakh+ restaurant partners and millions of customers!\u00a0\nThe team that made it all possible\u00a0\nWe would like to express our heartfelt thanks to folks from our AI and ML team, Catalog tech team, and Content Operations team who collaborated beautifully to make it all possible \u2013 Jayesh Gupta, Poonam Thapar, Abhilash Awasthi, Ram Singla, Suraj Rajput, Neel Agarwal, Deepak Deora, Jahnvi Goyal. Special mention to Jayesh Gupta for driving this project with passion and his enthusiasm.\nSo, embark on this delectable journey with us and let your eyes savor the flavor of enhanced food imagery on Zomato. It\u2019s a visual treat that will leave you craving more. Bon app\u00e9tit!"

        "author": "Anjalli Kumar",
        "content": "We want to make Zomato a place that provides equitable access to opportunities for all genders. We want to be a sustainable company that the nation, and equally importantly, our parents will be proud of, in how we help in creating a better society. As part of this effort, we have been introducing more women workers into different parts of our business, so our efforts at creating meaningful opportunities for women do not stop within the confines of our offices.\nWe have already onboarded over 2,000 women delivery partners into our food delivery fleet and will continue to work hard to multiply that number. Another crucial area where we see opportunity to create roles for women is in our warehouses and dark stores, housed within our Hyperpure and Blinkit businesses. Here are some learnings as we start introducing women workers into supply chain jobs at these facilities \u2013\u00a0\nWhat we\u2019re learning about gender diversity in our warehouses and dark stores\nBoth the Blinkit and Hyperpure businesses rely on workers in roles such as loading, unloading, picking, sorting, grading, security and housekeeping. However, the proportion of women across our warehouse and dark store facilities is currently low (<5%).\u00a0\nWe initiated a pilot at two of our Delhi and Mumbai warehouses and a dark store in Delhi to learn about the impact of having more women on the shopfloor, the targets we could feasibly set and investments required to make the warehouse/store environment more conducive for women.\u00a0\nWe onboarded 46 women in total \u2013 about 15% of the warehouse day shift workforce and 40% of the dark store workforce \u2013 and here are some business benefits we experienced in 2 months \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\nWomen improved the metrics around handling products within stores and warehouses\nWe witnessed that women workers were much more careful with respect to handling perishable categories of products like eggs, fruits and vegetables. In both warehouse locations, complaints raised against orders handled by women were ~16% less than men\n1\n. Warehouse managers also highlighted that women workers\u00a0paid great attention to detail and set high-quality standards for sorting and grading, especially for fresh produce.\nWomen take fewer unplanned leaves\nIn dark stores, women took less than half the unplanned leaves than men took\n2\n. Unplanned leaves affect existing distribution of tasks among workers and hampers store productivity.\nWomen have lower attrition rates than men\nIn locations that were accessible by public transport, it was observed that no woman left within the first 15 days of joining\n3\n. This could be as much behavioural as a reflection on the availability of opportunities.\nWomen demonstrate higher productivity across a variety of roles\n\u00a0\nIn a business that runs on hyper efficient operations, time is money. In our dark store pilot, women took ~ 28% less time than men to process orders as a result of being faster at responding, picking and billing\n4\n. In warehouses, when women were engaged in a variety of tasks, instead of being confined to working in a specific section, they demonstrated productivity gains in the range of 5-11% in tasks like sorting and grading.\nWomen significantly impact the working environment, positively\nManagers across all pilot locations pointed out that the culture of the facility improved post deployment of women. These cultural improvements included improved language at the facility, fewer altercations, and higher levels of cleanliness and hygiene.\n\u201cWomen keep their working environment clean and hygienic.\u201d\nWarehouse Manager, Mumbai\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n\u201cSince the time I started working here, I have grown as a leader. I like helping out the other women here and together we have made a community where we can help and inspire each other.\u201d\nHina, 30 years, mother of a 10-year old who works as a picker in our Delhi facility\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\nChallenges we are focusing on overcoming\nPlanning for and maintaining additional female washrooms\u00a0\nProvisioning for additional washrooms for women is less of an issue in our warehouses as they have a lot more space for amenities. For smaller facilities, such as dark stores, we have begun planning for these in advance to enable onboarding of women.\u00a0\nProviding dedicated transport to encourage better women\u2019s participation in roles outside city centres\nWe have begun providing transport for women for select warehouses in outskirts of the city and have found onboarding to be much easier. In one location, we were able to onboard 75% more women than we were before. Provision of transportation also significantly improves the perceived safety associated with the opportunity.\nIdeally, women need someone of their own gender to approach for support at workplace\nSeveral women workers face challenges with expressing their desire to work and explaining their work to their families. This is in line with larger studies published by our workforce diversity programme partners \nFSG GLOW\n, that show, while 1 in 2 women wish to work, 84% women need to secure family\u2019s permission beforehand and most families prefer women don\u2019t work at all.\u00a0\nDuring our pilot, a female packer and Master\u2019s student in Delhi, who was uncomfortable telling her family she was also working, preferred to say she was going out to study. When the course she was enrolled in ended, she had to leave.\u00a0\nTo address this cultural reality, we\u2019re ensuring that HR managers, management team and executives at warehouses include a mix of men and women. We believe women workers will find it easier to approach women managers for support and guidance, before they are forced to leave due to family pressure or other concerns.\nInclusion training for managers and workers beyond mandatory POSH training\nWhile FSG\u2019s research shows that women are willing to work in male-dominated environments, the on ground imbalance requires regular reinforcement of the fact that warehouses provide a safe and inclusive working environment where women\u2019s voices are also respected. We are planning inclusion programmes, beyond mandatory training, at both manager and worker levels addressing common biases and behaviours that can come in the way of our objectives.\u00a0\nThe way forward\nThe pilot has helped address key questions for us \u2013 the impact of having more women working in our facilities and the hard and soft infrastructure elements we need to invest in to facilitate their onboarding. The results show that women demonstrate the ability to perform many warehouse/store tasks at par or better than men. The key investments that need to be made \u2013 provisioning for and maintaining hygienic washroom facilities, providing transport for selected locations and inclusion training for managers can, potentially, be recovered over time.\nWe aim to reach\u00a0a target of\u00a020% women in our warehousing operations in 2024. We believe our commitment to get this agenda right, coupled with India\u2019s vast pool of inspiring women, like Hina, will help us meet our goals, like many of our orders, \nbefore time\n.\nWe are committed to ensuring we have more women at the table, shaping the future of every business we are in today \u2013 online ordering, food and grocery deliveries, and ideating for those we will be in tomorrow.\u00a0\nStay tuned for more diversity dialogues from Zomato.\nData valid for complaints in April \u2013 May 2023 \n\u21a9\ufe0e\nData valid for 31st May 2023 \u2013 6th August 2023. \n\u21a9\ufe0e\nData represents all workers who joined between 1st April 2023 and 15th May 2023. \n\u21a9\ufe0e\nThis includes assign to start time \u2013 billing time. \n\u21a9\ufe0e"

        "content": "At Zomato, we understand that the success of our platform hinges on delivering outstanding service to our customers, restaurant partners and delivery partners. To achieve this, we embarked on a transformative Android engineering journey with our Zomato Restaurant Partner App, focusing on optimizing performance, enhancing the overall user experience, and bolstering app stability.\u00a0\nWe are deeply committed to providing a seamless experience through our restaurant partner app, that enables our restaurant partners to efficiently handle incoming orders, streamline operations and have an elevated user experience with Zomato.\nHere\u2019s everything that we did \u2013\nWe applied a straightforward rule to examine our overheads. Our assessment of solutions was centered around their return on investment and the level of effort demanded from our engineering team. With these criteria as our guiding principles, we began a significant journey of improvement, categorizing our work into 7 key areas:\n1.\n \nInitial Load Time of the App:\nIn the world of Android development, ensuring a swift and seamless initial load time is paramount. Users expect apps to launch quickly and be responsive from the moment they tap the app launch icon. Achieving this requires a deep understanding of the platform and the various components that come into play during the app startup. One crucial element in this process is the Application class.\u00a0\nThe Application class in Android serves as a base class for maintaining global application state and is instantiated before any other component when an app starts. It provides a centralized location for initializing and managing resources and state that need to be accessible throughout the entire app\u2019s lifecycle.\nSubclassing an \nApplication\n is generally unnecessary. However, in the context of a substantial codebase and numerous teams crafting user experiences within the same app, it is not uncommon to overlook this fundamental principle. In such complex environments, maintaining simplicity can be challenging. Nevertheless, adhering to this principle remains crucial for codebase coherence and streamlined development. It ensures that changes and enhancements are implemented efficiently, benefiting the entire team and app ecosystem.\n2. Defer initializations:\nWe removed several non-critical feature configurations/ 3rd party SDKs initializations from the main thread execution and managed to defer them as per the requirements within our app, allowing for \ndynamic delivery\n when needed.\n3. Making use of the \nExecutorService\n:\u00a0\nWe assessed ways to prevent other background apps from utilizing a core during our setup process and leveraged the ExecutorService to cache threads within a pool. These threads are assigned maximum priority, ensuring that the device prioritizes tasks related to our startup process, optimizing overall efficiency.\n4. Eliminating Unnecessary Delays in Splash Screens:\nWe examined and optimized the actions performed during this phase. Upon walking through our code, we found multiple delays and time taking configuration operations which could\u2019ve been avoided and/or cached based on our requirements. We eliminated these delays on the splash screen, and achieved a significant reduction in the overall time required for the app to become operational.\n5. Enhancing Rendering Performance:\u00a0\nWe knew that optimizing how our app displays lists of items was crucial. To do so, we utilized \nRecyclerView prefetching\n, which works by preloading items in a list that are anticipated to become visible soon, enhancing the overall app performance. It involves asynchronous loading of items that are not yet on the screen but are likely to be scrolled into view.\u00a0\nSince the UI Thread does not do any work in the gap between frames, we were able to use that idle time to get work done that we will need later.\nWe also made use of \nViewStub\n which is a nifty feature utilized to enhance our app\u2019s performance. It allowed us to delay the inflation of complex or resource-intensive layouts until they were actually needed on the screen. This deferred loading conserved resources and memory, and eventually led to faster initial app launch times and smoother interactions.\n6. Profiling:\nAndroid Studio offers profiler, a robust tool for monitoring CPU activity, memory usage, and trace analysis similar to Perfetto. It allowed us to perform a detailed examination of the app\u2019s operations. As we assessed our app, we identified inefficiencies in our views and memory utilization. Consequently, we embarked on enhancing our caching mechanism and maximizing view reuse wherever feasible.\n7. Memory Leaks:\u00a0\nWe integrated \nLeakCanary\n into our app to tackle all the quirky memory leaks, as they can lead to sluggish rendering and even ANRs (Application Not Responding) in the app, impacting user experience.\nBy implementing all the optimizations, our cold start times plummeted from 27% in February to an impressive 1.4%. Furthermore, we slashed frozen frame occurrences from 3.72% to 1.99%. With this monumental improvement, restaurant partners now enjoy lightning-fast access to critical information. Orders, menu updates, customer feedback, and other essential data are at their fingertips almost instantly, regardless of their network conditions.\u00a0\nThis reduction in load time has not only benefited restaurant partners but has also translated into an exceptional user experience for customers. Orders are actioned upon more quickly, and delivery times are reduced, all contributing to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty. As a result, in about 4 months, our app rating on the Google Play Store went from 4.1 to 4.8!\nThe Pursuit of Excellence Continues\nOur relentless pursuit of excellence finds its manifestations in the enhancements we\u2019ve achieved for the Zomato Restaurant Partner App so far. Through deep analysis, strategic optimizations, and an unwavering commitment to delivering the best possible experience, we\u2019ve not only achieved tangible improvements but also fortified the app\u2019s technical quality. As we forge ahead, we remain dedicated to refining and enhancing the app, solidifying our position as a trusted partner for the restaurant partners countrywide.\n\u2013 \nAndroid Engineering Team (Zomato Restaurant Partner)"

        "content": "A seamless and speedy user experience can determine an app\u2019s success by improving retention rates and thereby making a big difference for a business. In our commitment to providing an exceptional user experience, we utilize a wide range of optimization methods and techniques, and in this blog, we shine light on one such technique: \nBaseline Profiles\n. This game-changing approach has significantly enhanced our app\u2019s startup, demonstrating its power in the realm of Android app optimization.\nBaseline Profiles help apps to start and run faster by optimizing \ncritical code paths\n ahead of time, resulting in a smoother and seamless user experience. When we include a Baseline Profile in an app or software, Android Runtime (\nART\n) can make the important parts of the code run faster before we even use them. This helps the app work better for everyone who uses it, whether they just downloaded it or updated it. This special way of making things faster is called \nProfile Guided Optimization\n (\nPGO\n) which means that the app can start faster, work smoother, and be better overall right from the very first time you open it.\nHow does it work?\nTo understand its working, let\u2019s see how an app compilation works. The source code is first compiled into bytecode and then converted into Dalvik Executable (DEX) bytecode for Android\u2019s runtime. Resources like images and layouts are compiled too. Then, these components are packaged into an APK, signed with a digital certificate, and then installed on an Android device.\nUpon the initial execution following an installation or an update, the app\u2019s code functions in an interpreted state until it undergoes \u201c\nJust-in-time\n\u201d compilation (\nread more\n). While Java and Kotlin code within the APK is converted into dex bytecode, full translation into machine code is avoided (as of \nAndroid 6\n) due to storage and loading expenses. Both app classes and methods that observe regular usage, including those pivotal for app initiation, are logged in a profile document. As the device enters an idle mode, ART compiles the applications using these profiles, resulting in an accelerated launch for subsequent app instances.\nCloud Profiles\nStarting with \nAndroid 9\n (API level 28), Google Play also provides \nCloud Profiles\n. As an app operates on a device, the profiles generated by ART are transmitted via the Play Store app and aggregated within the cloud. Once a sufficient number of profiles have been uploaded for a specific application, the Play app uses the aggregated profile for subsequent installs.\nProblem With Cloud Profiles\nWhile Cloud Profiles are great when they are available, they aren\u2019t always ready to be used when an app is installed. Collecting and aggregating the profiles usually takes several days, which is a problem in the context of frequent weekly app updates. This often results in users updating their apps prior to the Cloud Profile being ready. The \nGoogle Android team\n has been looking for other ways to improve the latency of profiles.\nBaseline Profiles are a new mechanism to provide profiles which can be used on \nAndroid 7\n (API level 24) and higher. A baseline profile is an ART profile generated by the Android Gradle plugin using a human readable profile format, which can be supplied by apps and libraries. An example might look like this:\nHSPLandroidx/compose/runtime/ComposerImpl;->updateValue(Ljava/lang/Object;)V\nHSPLandroidx/compose/runtime/ComposerImpl;->updatedNodeCount(I)I\nHLandroidx/compose/runtime/ComposerImpl;->validateNodeExpected()V\nPLandroidx/compose/runtime/CompositionImpl;->applyChanges()V\nHLandroidx/compose/runtime/ComposerKt;->findLocation(Ljava/util/List;I)I\nBaseline Profiles are created during build time, becoming a component of the APK shipped to the Play Store, and subsequently distributed to users upon app downloads.They fill the gap in the ART Cloud Profile pipeline, when Cloud Profiles are not yet available, and automatically merge with Cloud Profiles once they are.\nGetting Started with Baseline Profiles\nGenerating Baseline Profiles\n is straightforward. One can use the \nJetpack Macrobenchmark library\n to create a simple instrumentation test. This test should cover critical user journeys within the app, guaranteeing the optimization of the most important parts.\nWhile creating a test for a user journey within our app, we encountered significant challenges concerning the configuration of our \nZomato\n application. These challenges encompassed tasks such as permission management and the establishment of mock locations. When we ran our app in \nFirebase Test Lab\n or Emulator, it was not able to run the user journeys test because of the different environment. We needed to replicate the similar configuration of the app, mimicking how a typical user interacts with it. Given the limited availability of resources on writing tests with \nUiAutomator\n, we navigated these hurdles through a process of trial and error, drawing insights from various sources to successfully integrate these functionalities into our testing framework.\nWe\u2019ve implemented a GitHub Action that automates the execution of these tests, ensuring the generation of a baseline profile on \nFirebase Test Lab\n just before each app release.\ngcloud firebase test android run \\\n--type instrumentation \\\n--app ${{ env.APK_PATH }} \\\n--test ${{ env.TEST_PATH }} \\\n--device model=oriole,version=33,locale=en,orientation=portrait \\\n--directories-to-pull /sdcard/Android/media/com.zomato.benchmark \\\n--test-targets \"class com.zomato.benchmark.BaselineProfileGenerator\" \\\n--timeout 1200s \\\n--num-flaky-test-attempts 1\nOnce generated, the profile file is placed in your app\u2019s source folder. It gets merged with profiles from other dependencies and is included in your app bundle, ready to be distributed via Google Play.\nVerifying the Benefits\nYou can verify the performance benefits of Baseline Profiles through field metrics, such as \nGoogle Play Vitals\n, or by running benchmarks locally on a device. The results are typically faster app startups and smoother experiences. It reduced our app cold startup by ~\n20% \nfrom 3.47% to 2.81%.\nA Better User Experience\nIn conclusion, Baseline Profiles are a game-changer for Android app developers. They offer a straightforward way to enhance your app\u2019s performance without major code overhauls. New users get faster initial experiences, and existing users enjoy more consistent performance. So, why not make a Baseline Profile and give your users the snappiest app experience possible?\nReferences\nhttps://android-developers.googleblog.com/2022/01/improving-app-performance-with-baseline.html\nhttps://developer.android.com/topic/performance/baselineprofiles/overview\nhttps://www.droidcon.com/2022/06/28/making-apps-blazing-fast-with-baseline-profiles/\nhttps://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/04/improving-app-performance-with-art.html\nhttps://medium.com/androiddevelopers/improving-performance-with-baseline-profiles-fdd0db0d8cc6"

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/introducing-tips-for-the-kitchen-staff/",
        "author": "Jahnvi Goyal",
        "content": "We are excited to launch the \u2018Tips for the kitchen staff\u2019 feature on our platform that now allows our customers to show appreciation for the food our restaurant partners prepare for them, every time they order. At Zomato, we understand that a lot of hard work, skill, and creativity goes behind preparing food, and we keep asking ourselves \u2013 how can we motivate not just the restaurants but also their kitchen staff to continue working their magic. And to motivate them, we have introduced \u2018Tips for the kitchen staff\u2019. With this feature, customers can tip the restaurant\u2019s kitchen staff \u2013 the wonderful chefs, cleaning staff, helpers, etc. as a way of appreciation. This new feature will enrich the food ordering and delivery experience for both our restaurant partners and customers.\u00a0\nBuilding on the success of a 2018 initiative that allows customers to tip delivery partners, this is a similar initiative which is introduced based on inputs from Zomato\u2019s restaurant partner network. The introduction of \u2018Tips for the kitchen staff\u2019 feature enables the customers to seamlessly express gratitude for their food deliveries, an option that was limited to traditional dining-in experience until now.\nAs a customer, what are the options I have to tip?\nFor a seamless customer experience, customers are asked if they would like to tip the restaurant\u2019s kitchen staff after they have rated their order 4 or 5 stars. Customers also have the option to tip the restaurant kitchen staff from the live order tracking page after placing the order.\u00a0\nWe recognize that the customers are used to paying a service charge in terms of % of their order value. Therefore, on the platform you will find the option to tip the kitchen staff in % ranging from 3% to 10% of your item value. However, if you do not want to select from one of the pre defined % slabs, you can also enter any amount of your choice up to a maximum cap.\nHow do the restaurants receive tips?\nThe entire tip amount that customers pay is credited to restaurants (after any tax deductions, if applicable) to be distributed among their staff. Zomato does not keep any commissions out of the tip amount and it is passed through 100%. Our restaurant partners can keep a track of tips in their weekly payouts and statement of account on the merchant app or web dashboard.\nIf you are from the restaurant management, we ask you to sign a pledge to distribute the entire amount among your staff, should you be keen to be included in the program! This feature is now live on our platform and we are truly looking forward to providing an elevated food ordering and delivery experience to both our customers and restaurant partners!\u00a0\nThe team that made it all possible\u00a0\nWe would like to express our heartfelt thanks to the team that made it all possible in a small amount of time \u2013 Prateek from the design team and Ritick, Satyaprakash, Ishika, Rishabh, Devang, Saksham, Tanishq, Dilip. Special mention to Rana \u2013 our engineering rock star for seamlessly ensuring collaboration between multiple teams such as billing tech, merchant tech, consumer tech, iOS and Android to launch this update.\nThe next time you love something you order from your favorite restaurant, thank the team behind the scenes in a way that motivates them a lot. With a tip!"

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/introducing-vinifera/",
        "author": "Security Team",
        "content": "Vinifera is an open-source monitoring tool that detects and responds to accidental or critical sensitive leaks. It monitors public contributions made by developers across their repositories, forks, and gists, and notifies if any sensitive information is leaked. Started as a tool to monitor Github activity, Vinifera has now evolved to support multiple platforms like Gitlab, Slack and Asana.\nSince we started using Vinifera in 2019, we have been able to prevent many accidental leaks on public platforms. We also \nopen-sourced major components of Vinifera\n with the hope that it can help other companies in strengthening their security posture.\nAddressing Security Vulnerabilities: Vinifera\u2019s Solution for Data Exposures and Proactive Monitoring\nSensitive data exposures are common yet frequently overlooked security vulnerabilities that are faced by many organizations. This vulnerability class is hard to avoid due to multiple points of exposure and is easy to exploit, making it a sweet target for researchers.\nFrom an outsider\u2019s perspective, getting data from internal sources is hard, but it is easy to monitor and wait for someone else to make that information public. The severity of such leaks can range from minor to critical. For example, the leakage of an internal database schema, while not posing an immediate security risk, could potentially assist someone in connecting relevant information and uncovering potential vulnerabilities. The leak of third-party API keys and credentials is not only concerning, but it also exposes the associated data to potential attacks \u2013 providing attackers with an opportunity to infiltrate the network further. In order to address these security vulnerabilities, the following is done \u2014\nWe host an internal \nprivate-bin\n and \nCyberchef\n instance to facilitate easy sharing of internal data and provide essential capabilities for developers in terms of data transformation. While this approach offers some level of support, it does not entirely resolve the problem.\nVinifera provides continuous monitoring capabilities that enable swift identification and response to leaks. By tracking and scanning registered sources such as users, repositories and gists, Vinifera promptly detects changes or anomalies. This proactive approach enhances data security by allowing for immediate action and risk mitigation towards data leak.\nVinifera\u2019s Development Journey\nVinifera was built using a standard Rails app. The development process involved the following key components \u2014\nSidekiq: \nSidekiq\n is used for efficient job lifecycle management, enabling tasks such as scheduling and retries\nGitleaks Integration: \nGitleaks\u2019\n Docker image is used for scanning with communication facilitated through the Docker API\nData Storage and Cache: \nPostgres\n was chosen as the persistent data store, while Redis served as the application cache, ensuring reliable performance\nSlack Integration: Vinifera provides real-time monitoring and event checking through Slack\nOn-Call Team Collaboration: Pager events are triggered to notify the on-call team and respond to any security incidents.\nVinifera\u2019s Operations\nVinifera\u2019s operations can be broadly categorized into three key phases \u2014\nDiscovery: During the discovery phase, Vinifera scans and identifies all assets, actively searching for new targets to monitor. Once identified, these targets are registered for ongoing monitoring and polling.\nLifecycle: After onboarding a new employee into our GitHub organization, we initiate a registration process where they are identified as targets. Subsequently, we conduct comprehensive scans on their public repositories and Gist \u2013 treating them as \u201cassets\u201d. To efficiently track changes, revisions to each asset are stored in a manner that allows quick identification of modifications.\nScanning: Scanning is triggered via Sidekiq, and all scans are performed within isolated Docker containers, ensuring secure and reliable execution. The scanning process varies based on the type of scan required \u2013 whether it is a repository scan or an analysis of raw files. Vinifera further leverages Datadog to monitor relevant statistics and ensure the overall health of the service.\nAn Overview of the Vinifera System\nAfter a successful execution of the \u201ctarget_monitor\u201d Sidekiq job, it is re-enqueued for the subsequent scan, with the enqueue information stored in the database. This enables fine-tuning and control over the timing of the next scan.\nIn the event of failures, Vinifera carefully analyzes the type of errors encountered. If the failures are attributed to issues with GitHub or the Docker Box, appropriate measures are taken to handle and throttle jobs, providing the system with a window to avoid further errors.\nScalability Enhancements: Boosting Stability and Performance\nTo enhance the stability and scalability of Vinifera, we implemented several measures \u2014\nAuto throttling of jobs based on error types: When relying on third-party services or internal services with limited capacity, it is necessary to have checks to avoid overwhelming the service. We introduced auto throttling of jobs based on error types, dynamically adjusting limits for specific periods. This approach helps avoid disruption caused by exponential retries, ensuring smooth operation of the service.\nCaching GitHub API responses to avoid rate limiting: To mitigate rate-limiting issues, we leveraged caching of GitHub API responses. We employed the \nfaraday-http-cache\n library, utilizing response headers like Etag, Last-Modified and Age to cache the responses in Redis. This however, comes with a small impact on storage since responses are now stored in Redis memory.  To ensure efficient storage management, Vinifera employs a selective caching approach. Heavy responses and resources that are not needed for future access are intentionally excluded from the caching process.\nOptimized scanning of big forks and external projects: Scanning large forks, such as those of substantial open-source projects, posed resource utilization challenges. To address this, we directly determined and scanned the commit patch instead of cloning the entire fork. One of the main causes that spiked resource usage on our Docker daemon was scanning big forks. This arose when a developer forked a large open-source project for contribution, and we scanned the entire repo to look for violations. Some forks were enormous (for example, Linux kernel repo, odoo, android AOSP source code) and sometimes caused the cluster to choke. In some cases, the maximum memory used for scanning reached almost 1GB and ~99% of the total\u00a0CPU. By leveraging the user activity GitHub API, we could quickly identify commits pushed by developers to collaborative projects or forks, extracting the relevant patch for direct scanning.\nRunning scans on a dedicated docker daemon: Separating scanning operations to a dedicated machine greatly improved performance and prevented resource congestion. By isolating the scanning process on a separate Docker daemon, we were able to limit the blast radius in case of any issues. This approach ensured the continuity of discovery operations in an uninterrupted manner, in spite of\u00a0 the dedicated Docker machine experiencing errors. Additionally, we optimized resource allocation by restricting scans to a single CPU core and a fraction of CPU weight, preventing resource exhaustion.\nExpanding Platform Support: Vinifera\u2019s Multi-Service Compatibility\nVinifera\u2019s journey began as a monitoring tool for GitHub sources, but it naturally evolved to support GitLab and other services as well. Depending on the platform, Vinifera employs different monitoring approaches to ensure comprehensive coverage \u2014\nAsset Monitoring Approach: Services like GitHub and GitLab are monitored using an asset monitoring approach. This involves registering assets and continuously looking for any changes or updates.\nQuery-Based Monitoring: Services like Slack, Asana, and Intelx are monitored using a query-based approach. Vinifera periodically polls search results against fixed queries, detecting any changes or relevant information.\nCurrently, Vinifera supports scanning for the following platforms \u2014\nGitHub\nGitLab\nSlack\nAsana\nIntelx\nIntelx\n, specifically, serves as a valuable source for monitoring information exposures across various assets. It functions as a search engine that collects and indexes information from multiple public sources. Vinifera leverages Intelx to identify and neutralize any potential exposure risks proactively.\nDistributed Security Alerting\nWe built a robust alerting and acknowledgment system \u2013 DiSeAl (Distributed Security Alerting) to distribute the security alerting across the entire organization and integrated it with Vinifera. Whenever a new resource is registered in Vinifera, our internal lookup logic identifies the corresponding owner within our organization. Subsequently, an alert is sent to the owner, ensuring they are promptly notified of any new public assets associated with their account discovered on Vinifera. This proactive approach empowers users to stay vigilant and report any accidental exposures, aiding in identifying and mitigating potential risks\nConclusion\nVinifera serves as a powerful monitoring tool, proactively detecting and mitigating accidental leaks across multiple platforms. Vinifera strengthens the security posture with continuous monitoring, robust alerting, and multi-tenant support. With Vinifera, we can take proactive measures to identify and mitigate potential risks, bolster data protection, and prevent leaks.By open-sourcing Vinifera, Zomato aims to contribute to the broader security community, inviting others to strengthen their security postures and swiftly identify and mitigate potential leaks. If you are passionate about solving security problems at scale, we would love to hear from you at \ninfosechiring@zomato.com\n."

        "content": "Hack-a-Noodle, a Zomato-hosted exhilarating 24-hour hackathon that brought together creativity and extraordinary ideas, unfolded with two thrilling dimensions. On one side, the stage was set for external participants, bringing their exciting and innovative projects to life. The stakes were high, as these brilliant minds had a chance to win prizes and secure potential employment at Zomato. On the other side, Zomato\u2019s own tech team formed dynamic groups of 5-6 members, diving head first into the challenge of crafting solutions.\nThe atmosphere buzzed with energy as all participants set out to create something extraordinary, whether it was an improvement or a complete disruption to the status quo. Throughout the 24 hours of non-stop coding, the office was a hub of inspiration and determination. A plethora of brilliant ideas were pitched and brought to life. Passionate individuals worked tirelessly through the night, driven by their motivation and excitement. Hack-a-Noodle was an unforgettable journey of imaginativeness, collaboration and ingenuity, leaving a lasting impact on everyone involved. The goal was to shape the tech future of Zomato and beyond.\nIn this blog, we\u2019ll take you through the exciting journey of the in-house hackathon champions. The winning team was an ensemble of 5 brilliant minds from the iOS team: Mehul Srivastava, Nakul Sakhuja, Rajesh Budhiraja, Archana Kumari and Inder Deep Singh. Their extraordinary creation, christened as Kimchi, is a groundbreaking on-the-fly UI rendering engine tailored exclusively for iOS. So, let\u2019s embark on a deep dive to uncover the captivating story behind Kimchi \u2013 exploring its essence, significance and the fascinating intricacies that brought it to life.\nThe Journey of Kimchi\nContext\nBefore we start with what Kimchi is, let\u2019s understand where Zomato was before this idea was conceived.\u00a0\nSushi\nWe had been using a standardized library of UI elements, known as \nSushi\n, across its various apps. This system defines the characteristics of all basic UI elements like Label, Button, ImageView, IconView and more. Each of these views also have a model associated with them which is used to configure their look and feel. For instance, the LabelObject has attributes that are needed to configure a Label such as text, color, font and the number of lines.\nExample of a Sushi LabelObject\n{\n    \"label\": {\n        \"text\": \"this is a label\",\n        \"font\": {\n            \"weight\": \"bold\",\n            \"size\": \"500\"\n        },\n        \"color\": {\n            \"type\": \"black\",\n            \"tint\": \"500\"\n        },\n        \"number_of_lines\": 1\n    }\n}\nSushi system allows us to maintain a uniform look, feel and behavior across all screens in the app. App developers are only required to arrange these Sushi elements within a card or a view according to the design requirements. We also have the objects for each element on the backend which are sent to the app, and the app can set the appearance accordingly. This also allows us to have reusable views as we can control the appearance of each element without any change in the app.\nLimitations of Sushi\nAlthough Sushi eases a lot of problems for us when it comes to making a UI, there are still things that it cannot do \u2013 the biggest of which is that the app governs how these Sushi elements are placed with respect to each other. So, in order to ship a new UI, we need to write code for it on the app using Sushi elements, which is nothing more than an arrangement of those elements. Once we have coded the arrangement, we do an app release, wait for a certain adoption level and then take the feature live. This process takes at least 3 weeks, which feels too sluggish considering our aspiration for speed and constant iteration.\nThis naturally begs the question, what if we move the arrangement of Sushi elements to the backend as well? That would give us the power to control the whole UI from the backend itself, in real-time. We had this idea for quite some time, but due to various constraints, we hadn\u2019t been able to experiment with them until the arrival of Hack-a-Noodle 2022. The hackathon gave us the perfect opportunity to delve into this exciting possibility and bring it to life.\n24 Hours of Hackathon\nWe thought this was the perfect opportunity to try and build something like Kimchi and jumped in without knowing if it was possible or not. We had 24 hours to figure it out and potentially create something. We drew inspiration from SwiftUI\u2019s syntax to arrange Sushi elements in the view. We used containers like hStack, vStack and zStack to arrange elements in horizontal, vertical and z axes respectively.\nProposed response for rendering 2 labels arranged horizontally\nAside from writing a custom implementation of zStack, we already had everything in Sushi and iOS\u2019s UIKit. We used UIStackView to make hStack and vStack. We decided to implement Kimchi using UIKit and not SwiftUI because our current codebase was already in UIKit and we were working within a 24 hour deadline.\nOnce we had all the basic elements ready, we had to plug them into the app to see how they look and perform. We rendered our homepage using Kimchi and were blown away. The homepage rendered with Kimchi was virtually identical to our existing version, and even the scrolling performance held up reasonably well, especially given that we weren\u2019t reusing the KimchiViews at all. We were so pumped to see this that we created another page in the app using Kimchi. The pull request was just a JSON file which, we believe, is kind of legendary and hilarious at the same time.\nWe presented the idea and implementation to the judges across various rounds. Everyone could see this was revolutionary. Although there were other great ideas which made it through to the finals of the hackathon, it was a unanimous decision to give the winning award to Kimchi. The speed of execution and business impact that this could potentially bring would only be limited by our capability of taking advantage of it. It basically eliminates the need for even an app developer to ship a new UI.\nThe Architecture of Kimchi\nLooking at the response, you might be able to understand that Kimchi views are recursive in nature. However, let\u2019s look at how the UI is rendered from the configuration using our previous example of two horizontally stacked labels.\nEvery KimchiView has exactly one subview in it. The type of this subview is decided by the response. For example, KimchiView created with type hStack will have one UIStackView with its axis set to horizontal. Now this hStack, will have an array of items which will all be KimchiViews as well. Their subview will be determined by their specific types. For example, the view hierarchy would look something like this.\nKimchiView -> UIStackView -> [\nKimchiView -> SushiLabel,\nKimchiView -> SushiLabel\n]\nTherefore, you just create one KimchiView and it creates more views inside it recursively.\nThe reason for embedding every view inside KimchiView is that we want certain functionalities in every view. Some examples are:\nPadding\nBackground Color/ Gradient\nCorner Radius\nBorder\nShadow\nWe\u2019re able to achieve this for any view that is supported by Kimchi without implementing it in every single view type. Also, doing it this way allows us to maintain these functionalities from one single place if anything needs to be changed in the future.\nHere\u2019s an example of a little complicated view using Kimchi. The response snippet along with the resultant image is provided below. \n{\n    \"type\": \"vStack\",\n    \"vStack\": {\n        \"padding\": {\n            \"all\": 20\n        },\n        \"alignment\": \"center\",\n        \"bg_color\": {\n            \"type\": \"red\",\n            \"tint\": \"200\"\n        },\n        \"corner_radius\": 12,\n        \"shadow\": {\n            \"color\": {\n                \"type\": \"grey\",\n                \"tint\": \"700\"\n            },\n            \"offset\": {\n                \"width\": 0,\n                \"height\": 0\n            },\n            \"radius\": 8,\n            \"opacity\": 0.2\n        },\n        \"items\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"image\",\n                \"image\": {\n                    \"url\": \"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/featured_v2.jpg\",\n                    \"aspect_ratio\": 1,\n                    \"height\": 50\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"type\": \"label\",\n                \"label\": {\n                    \"text\": \"Kimchi\",\n                    \"font\": {\n                        \"weight\": \"bold\",\n                        \"size\": \"500\"\n                    },\n                    \"color\": {\n                        \"type\": \"black\",\n                        \"tint\": \"500\"\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\nHackathon to Shipping\nNow that everyone had seen how impactful Kimchi could be for our day-to-day workflow at Zomato, all eyes were set on us to ship it. Before we could ship it though, there were a few things that needed figuring out. These issues included \u2014\nResponse size\nReusability\nResponse Size\nImagine if we have to render a horizontally scrolling rail of 100 identical looking cards in which only a few data fields change. This is a very common use case in any app, especially Zomato.\nPrior to Kimchi we would only get the differing fields in the backend response, resulting in efficient response size. With Kimchi, we would also be expecting the layout config for all the 100 cards, even though it is not changing at all. This would result in an astronomical increase in response size.\nThe problem is that a KimchiView takes only one configuration for initialisation. This configuration includes the static as well as dynamic part. Pre-Kimchi, this process had two steps \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\nStatic part was written in Swift and shipped in the app\nDynamic part was sent by backend and only it was set in the cards during reuse\nSo how do we separate the static & dynamic parts of the UI from a KimchiView?\nWe were back at the drawing board with this problem. We thought about how iOS implements the concept of Optionals. Optional is an enum which has two cases. First case is that there can be a value and the other is that there is no value, which means nil. What if we make our objects like Optionals? Either they hold the value or they hold the path of the value in the backend response.\u00a0\nThe Kimchi view config as well as the backend response is provided below.\n{\n    \"type\": \"hStack\",\n    \"hStack\": {\n        \"items\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"label\",\n                \"label\": {\n                    \"ref\": \"title\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"type\": \"label\",\n                \"label\": {\n                    \"text\": \"this is label 2\",\n                    \"color\": {\n                        \"type\": \"red\",\n                        \"tint\": \"500\"\n                    },\n                    \"font\": {\n                        \"weight\": \"bold\",\n                        \"size\": \"400\"\n                    },\n                    \"number_of_lines\": 1\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n{\n    \"title\": {\n        \"text\": \"this is label 1\",\n        \"color\": {\n            \"type\": \"red\",\n            \"tint\": \"500\"\n        },\n        \"font\": {\n            \"weight\": \"bold\",\n            \"size\": \"400\"\n        },\n        \"number_of_lines\": 1\n    }\n}\nIn the code examples above, the view configuration part has the static part, i.e. the part that will remain the same in a list of these cards. Note that we have added \u201cref\u201d instead of the object for that label in the view configuration. The value of this \u201cref\u201d, \u201ctitle\u201d, is the key name where we are expecting the object for that label in the backend response.\nWith the successful implementation of the Optionals-like approach in iOS, the backend response became agnostic to whether Kimchi was used or not. The response structure remained unchanged from the pre-Kimchi era. This achievement not only solved the problem of response size increase but also offered the advantage of independence from implementing Kimchi on Android.\nAlthough the team had plans to implement Kimchi on Android in the future, they prioritized its integration into their daily development processes on iOS. The reason behind this decision was to thoroughly test and explore the current implementation\u2019s capabilities and limitations. While the current version of Kimchi efficiently handled UI rendering, the team aspired to evolve it into a comprehensive UI engine that could handle interactions, animations, and ultimately render entire screens.\nWe made a generic enum called \u201cKimchiReferable\u201d, which can either have a \u201cref\u201d of type String or value of the generic type. This container is used to decode the layout configuration part of the Kimchi configuration.\npublic enum KimchiReferable<T: Decodable>: Decodable {\n    \n    case value(T)\n    case ref(String)\n    \n    private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {\n        case ref\n    }\n    \n    public init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {\n        if let container = try? decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self),\n           let ref = try? container.decode(String.self, forKey: .ref) {\n            self = .ref(ref)\n            return\n        }\n        let value = try T(from: decoder)\n        self = .value(value)\n    }\n}\nDecoding the data part posed a challenge since the types of data were unknown. For any decodable object, we need to define the keys and value types on the app. However, for Kimchi, that context is in the layout configuration. To overcome this, the team decoded the data part as a dictionary of [String: Any] type. This allowed us to navigate to the required key as per the \u201cref\u201d value in that dictionary, retrieving the data for that particular view. Additionally, they introduced\u00a0 support for going to a specific path in the response like \u201ctop_container/title\u201d and arrays like \u201csubtitles[2]\u201d in the \u201cref\u201d.\nAfter the modifications, our Kimchi view took two things for initialisation:\nLayout configuration, which represents the static part of the UI\nData object which corresponds to the dynamic part of the UI\nHowever, a challenge arose in setting the data for the view when it needed to be updated. While the current approach successfully created views during the initial rendering, the team needed a solution for uploading the data within the views for reuse and dynamic changes.\nReusability\nIn iOS\u2019s implementation of CollectionViews, it reuses cells with new data to display an extensive number of items. Kimchi faced challenges in achieving similar efficiency. Instead of reusing the existing views, Kimchi\u2019s current approach involved destroying the existing view and creating a new one based on the config, resulting in a more resource-intensive process. As a result, Kimchi\u2019s reuse process was far from efficient.\nWith successful separation of static and dynamic data, implementing efficient reuse becomes feasible by setting data only in the KimchiViews showing dynamic data. However, an issue arises due to nested view hierarchy, as there are no direct\u00a0 references to all subviews.\u00a0\nTo set data for specific views, we identified dynamic views with the \u201cref\u201d type in their layout configs. We then stored their references in a dictionary of type \u201c[String: KimchiView]\u201d where the \u201cref\u201d value served as the key and corresponding KimchiView as the value.\nAdditionally, we introduced a protocol called \u201cKimchiReferableContainerDelegate\u201d, which helped us in managing the references. It had a function to notify the \u201creferableContainerDelegate\u201d that the current KimchiView is referable. The root KimchiView had no \u201creferableContainerDelegate,\u201d while each KimchiView created by a KimchiView had its parent designated as the \u201creferableContainerDelegate.\u201d Within the implementation of the function in the protocol, two states were considered:\nIf the view had its own \u201creferableContainerDelegate,\u201d it would notify that delegate about the view and its \u201cref.\u201d\nIf the view did not have its own delegate, it would be stored in the current KimchiView\u2019s \u201creferableSubviews\u201d dictionary, using the \u201cref\u201d as the key.\nWhen a call was received to update data for a view using a new data object, we would look for the corresponding \u201cref\u201d in the dictionary. Upon finding the match, the specific data object to the corresponding KimchiView was passed, ensuring the view\u2019s data was accurately updated.\nBy this mechanism, our KimchiViews were just as reusable as our current views, leading to a massive performance improvement as only necessary\u00a0 minimum work was being done in the reuse process.\nWhere We Stand: Running Kimchi on Zomato\u2019s Homepage\nWe recently executed a successful pilot experiment on Zomato\u2019s homepage, where we replaced our recommendation rail running the traditional UIKit view with Kimchi\u2019s rendering. We integrated the layout configuration file into the app for this experiment, allowing us to evaluate Kimchi\u2019s looks, feel and performance in the real world. The entire transition was achieved without any disruption to our backend and Android teams, as Kimchi effortlessly worked with the existing backend response. This pilot was successful as the transition was unnoticeable, affirming Kimchi\u2019s seamless integration.\n\u200b\nUpcoming Endeavors\u00a0\nNow that our pilot has been successful, the goal is to make the Kimchi layout configurations back-end driven. This development would unlock the full potential of Kimchi by allowing us to ship new UI without any app release.\nA slightly longer term goal is to create a tool for designers which would allow them to design UIs and export the Kimchi configs for them automatically. This would essentially remove the need for an app developer to code the UI into Swift. With this, the business and design teams would be able to test out new UIs and run experiments with even deeper controls in real time."

When we move our bodies regularly, we are in better control of our emotions, we think more creatively, and have more energy to tackle more in a day, in a better way than before.\nIn 2019, a few months before the pandemic, I started treating my health as an equal priority to my work. My hypothesis was that I will be able to produce more and better quality work, if I am in peak physical (and mental) shape.\u00a0\nI started tracking my carb intake, ate a healthy diet (all ordered via Zomato; because Indian home cooked food is so dominated by carbs), and worked out regularly. I didn\u2019t do anything extreme, always had a day or two of cheat days on weekends (with cholle bhature, butter chicken, and gulab jamun and what not). But overall, I was consistent with more healthy behaviour each week compared to my previous habits. Consistency without extremities has had a positive effect on both my physical and psychological health.\nHere\u2019s a quick highlight of my vitals from 2019 as compared to today\u2019s blood report and a glance on the effect on my physical appearance.\nGreat work is an outcome of good health; good health is not secondary to great work. And we have always been promoting the importance of physical and mental health for our employees. For example we have \u2013\u00a0\nFitness Facility: Our Gurgaon headquarters has one of the city\u2019s largest gyms, encouraging our employees to embrace an active lifestyle.\nMental Health Support: We have an in-house mental health team offering a safe space for open conversations and professional guidance.\nLeave Policies: Period Leaves to support women\u2019s health; Parental Leaves offering 6 months of leave for birthing parents, same-sex parents, and parents via surrogacy and adoption.\u00a0\nToday, we are announcing a paradigm shift in the constitution of our senior team here at Zomato (and other companies?). We\u2019ve created a position for a new kind of CFO \u2014 \nChief Fitness Officer.\nWhat will our Chief Fitness Officer do?\nThe Chief Fitness Officer will work closely with all Zomans in their individual journey of wellness and healthy living. The\n \nnew CFO will work with an in-house wellness team of trainers, nutritionists and wellbeing counsellors.\nOur trainers will help in weight and strength training, yoga, boxing and more \u2013\u00a0to cater to beginners as well as pros.\u00a0\nOur nutritionists will chart out personalised meal plans for Zomans to track macro and micronutrient intake. Personally, I feel a good diet is 80% of the work in one\u2019s fitness journey.\nI believe companies need to remove the stigma around employees taking the time to care about fitness whilst at work \u2014 because only when people are healthy, they are equipped to accept and face the hardest challenges life throws at them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAnmol Gupta (insta: \nendurewithanmol\n) has joined us as our Chief Fitness Officer, and I am looking forward to working with him to transform the way people think about work. Going forward, we are going to invest heartily behind the wellbeing of our employees, our delivery partners and our restaurant partners. \nToday is, like always, just Day 1.\u00a0\nCheers,\u00a0\nDeepi\n\u2014\nLeaving you with some pictures from our gym \u2013\u00a0which is open throughout the day."

With a maximum production rate of 150 million logs per minute, this leads to the production of over 50 TB of uncompressed logs per day.\u00a0\nIn the past, we stored all of these logs on self-hosted Elasticsearch. However, as the traffic on our platform and our services grew over time, our logs increased exponentially. Given this increase, managing the clusters became difficult from an operational standpoint. Given the nature of the business, we also had to over-provision our clusters for the variable traffic patterns. While the costs kept rising, we were unable to provide the experience we had originally hoped to.\u00a0\nClicking with Clickhouse \u2013 Building LogStore\nIn the early days, we explored migrating a few sets of logs to S3 stored in \nORC format\n using apache-spark \u2013 which would be queryable through Trino. While it definitely brought down the cost substantially, querying such huge logs and keeping query runtimes generous under 10s wasn\u2019t possible. We had an ingestion lag of 5-10 minutes since we were writing large files to improve query latency. With the objective of keeping the end-to-end query latency under 1s and ingestion lag of less than a minute, we explored various options which could potentially replace the ELK stack.\nClickhouse emerged to be the best candidate for our use case, and we decided to move forward with it. It could handle terabytes of data while keeping the latency low. Also, Clickhouse is horizontally scalable, with a shared-nothing architecture. This further reduced the operational overhead.\nBehind the curtain: The wizardry of our design decisions\nWe used various design choices to achieve high performance from the setup while keeping the costs low.\nScale Description:\n As previously mentioned, the data size, at times, was more than 50 TB daily, with events peaking at 150M/ minute. The requirement for querying all these logs within seconds of their production was paramount. LogStore received about 12,000 queries/day with a time range from 15 minutes to 7 days. To cater to this, the Clickhouse cluster ran 10 AWS EC2 nodes of M6g.16xlarge. The current cluster was scaled up to cater to burst queries in case of any production incident.\nInserts:\n Instead of relying on Clickhouse Kafka plugins, we opted for custom Golang workers. These workers efficiently batched the requests and performed insertions into Clickhouse, significantly reducing the overhead on Clickhouse. To optimize costs, we ran these workers on spot instances, resulting in additional savings.\u00a0\nTo optimize performance, the inserts were batched to minimize I/O and CPU cycles. We grouped up to 20,000 messages per table, ensuring a maximum lag of 5 seconds. This approach significantly reduced the number of inserts at Clickhouse.\nFor faster data ingestion, we leveraged the native format to insert data into Clickhouse, achieving a speed boost of approximately 1.8 times compared to using HTTP. This native format was also less I/O intensive, resulting in more efficient processing by Clickhouse.\nTo distribute the workload evenly, the workers followed a round-robin strategy, inserting the batched logs into any available Clickhouse node. If a node was unavailable or under heavy load, the request was seamlessly redirected to another functioning node. This ensured a robust and reliable data ingestion process.\nSchema Design:\n One of the most significant challenges was designing a schema that could accommodate the semi-structured nature of logs. This was achieved\u00a0 by creating a semi-structured table design, where the logs\u2019 common columns are kept at the top level, and all unmatched columns are dumped into a map<String, String> column.\u00a0\nThis map exploded to the top level in the API, making it easy for clients to access the data. The top-level fields can use special codecs per column to improve the compression ratio. Also, we use LowCardinality String wherever possible to achieve a very high compression ratio for columns.\ncreate table if not exists foo_service (\n\tts          \tDatetime,\n\tenv         \tLowcardinailty(String),\n\tcontainer_id\tLowcardinailty(String),\n\ttrace_id    \tFixedString,\n\tmsg         \tString,\n\toffset      \tUint64 codec(DoubleDelta,zstd)\n\t_others     \tMap<LowCardinality(String), String>\n\tINDEX foo_service_msg_index\n\tTYPE tokenbf_v1(212062,3,0)\n\tGRANULARITY 1\n)\nEngine = MergeTree\nPartition by toYYYYMMDD(ts)\norder by (env, trace_id, ts)\nCustom SDK:\n The schema problem also needed to be fixed at the root level by urging the developers to use structured logging, instead of dumping everything into the message column and then finding a needle in the haystack. We built an SDK which helps in structuring the logs. This SDK standardized some top-level fields \u2013 like caller, log production time, log production stream, etc. so that it was easier to manage and clean up logs.\n   log.With(\n        log.Int(\"user_id\", userID),\n        log.String(\"url\", url),\n        log.Err(err),\n    ).Info(\"could not make http request\")\nSo that the user can search the logs with \nuser_id.equals(1)\n \ninstead of \nmessage like \u2018%user_id = 1 %\u2019\nFrontend:\n We built a custom dashboard for developers to apply filters and view logs. The dashboard\u2019s web vitals score is at par with industry standards with an \nFCP score\n of 0.95 seconds and an \nLCP score\n of 1.90 seconds. To achieve this, we used a lazy loading technique which defers loading of non-critical resources at page load time. We also built a filter application and date range picker flow which is open for any customizations in the future according to developer needs. Since log data is huge (approx 3K records / 1MB), we cannot render all the data on the page at once. We applied DOM virtualization concepts to render only a required number of records that are visible in the viewport.\nReplication:\n We opted out of replication, and consequently Zookeeper, to simplify operations since the data is already persistent on S3 and the attached EBS is being backed up. In case of an unmerry event, the new node gets attached to the EBS and is up and running in no time.\nData Tiering:\n We manage the data lifecycle by moving older data to the cold tier from the hot tier after every 24 hours using TTL and delete the data after 3 months . For our workload, which was mostly CPU and I/O bound, it made sense to use AWS Graviton C6g instances. To cope with IO-intensive workloads, each node was attached to multiple disks with gp3 disks with 4000 IOPS and 1000 MB/s.\nSecondary Indexes:\n By utilizing the \ntokenbf_v1 index\n, the speed of like queries improved as many parts were bypassed if the index didn\u2019t match. This was particularly beneficial for queries that involved scanning large amounts of data, which would otherwise be prohibitively costly to execute on their own and surpass scan limits.\nThe inverted index was recently added as an experimental feature in Clickhouse, but it led to frequent memory issues and performance degradation in our POC. We could switch to inverted indexes once it matures.\nDeciding the Size of Bloom Filter:\n \n\u201cA Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set.\u201d\n False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not \u2013 in other words, a query returns either \u201c\npossibly in set\n\u201d or \u201c\ndefinitely not in set\n\u201c.\u00a0 We used bloom filter in the tokenized message column to verify if the search query was present, effectively filtering out non-matching granules, thus speeding up the search results.\nFor each block of 8000 records with an average of 50 words per record, \nn \n( number of elements in a filter ) = 400K,\n p \n(probability of false positives ) as \n0.1 \nand \n3\n hash functions i.e. \nk.\n The size of filter per block tends to be 235 Kib. This helps in speedy search results which can handle all the records.\nn = ceil(m / (-k / log(1 \u2013 exp(log(p) / k))))\np = pow(1 \u2013 exp(-k / (m / n)), k)\nm = ceil((n * log(p)) / log(1 / pow(2, log(2))));\nk = round((m / n) * log(2));\nEnsuring resiliency of the system:\n The system implemented query throttling mechanisms at both the user and system levels to tackle the problem of performance degradation caused by an overwhelming number of queries.\u00a0\nIn instances where the system was inundated with a significant number of unoptimized queries, it selectively terminated the queries that were consuming excessive resources or taking an unreasonably long time to execute, prioritizing other queries and ensuring the system\u2019s continued availability to most users. Additionally, the read queries\u2019 niceness was enhanced to prioritize writes in case of any unforeseen issues.\nMonitoring: \nClickHouse server has embedded instruments for self-state monitoring. We scraped clickhouse metrics via prometheus, and then visualized and set alerts over it via grafana.\nWe closely monitored various system health metrics such as CPU, Memory and Network, as well as specific Clickhouse metrics like delayed or rejected inserts, insert time, and query time. This helped us ensure that the system is both reliable and performing optimally.\nIn addition, we measured 95th percentile query run time at the table level, enabling us to evaluate performance and identify patterns in query behavior. Based on these insights, we could take steps such as adding indexes or sort keys, improving logging patterns, and more, to improve overall system performance.\nSecurity:\n To ensure that only authorized individuals can access and query the logs, we employed features such as Google Authentication, Table-level access control, and Query Auditing. These measures helped enhance security and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.\nImpact\u00a0\nMigrating to ClickHouse had a significant impact on our systems. Here\u2019s how ClickHouse proved to be a game-changer:\nReliability: Real-time Data Ingestion \u2013 \nIngestion lag of less than 5 seconds ensured real-time data availability, minimizing discrepancies and supporting timely decision-making.\nPerformance: Lightning-Fast Queries \u2013 \nP99 query time of 10 seconds accelerated data processing, delivering actionable insights promptly. For example, querying the largest index with the right filters for 7 days takes less than 20 seconds.\nCustomizations: Tailored Solutions \u2013 \nOur in-house solution allowed us to customize and adapt the platform to our specific requirements. This flexibility surpasses the limitations we previously faced, such as losing visibility due to paid access logs.\nAuditing and Cost Savings \u2013 \nLogStore\u2019s auditing capabilities and cost-effectiveness has the potential to save more than a \nmillion dollars\n per year\n compared to our previous setup, without compromising on system reliability and security.\nWhat\u2019s the compass pointing towards?\nWith new services emerging every day and evolving requirements, our project\u2019s future plans include:\nEnhancing full-text search capabilities through the incorporation of inverted indexes.\nProviding LogQL query support to power advanced use cases.\nAdding support for similar logs and patterns to categorize errors and their frequency.\nBuilding an automated system to fine-tune indexes and improve search experience using query patterns.\nMigrating to \nOpen-Telemetry\n logging standard\nThis blog was written by \nAnmol Virmani\n and \nPalash Goel\n in collaboration with \nBhavya Rustgi\n and \nSameer Saxena\n, under the guidance of \nHimanshu Rathore\n and \nUmar Ahmad\n."

        "content": "Welcome to the third and final instalment of our three-part blog series! In parts\n one\n and \ntwo\n, we unveiled the secrets behind Zomato\u2019s powerful search engine, driven by Apache Solr, and shared our tactics for optimizing Solr\u2019s performance. In this concluding chapter, we\u2019ll take you behind the scenes of Zomato\u2019s\n self-managed Solr clusters\n to show how we tackled the challenges arising from this rapid growth and transformed the scalability, reliability, and performance of Solr.\nHitting the infrastructural bottlenecks\nInitially, we were running our Solr Clusters in Master-Slave Configuration. As Zomato\u2019s growth continued at a breakneck speed, the index size started growing, and we started facing a new set of challenges:\nTo improve performance, we had to run the slave nodes on extremely large machines (120GB RAM) with a large JVM Heap (~100GB), but this resulted in \npoor tail latencies\n due to the longer\u00a0 \nStop The World\n step in Garbage Collection.\nAdditionally, on every sync with the master, slaves had to open \nSearcher\n on a large index, and \nwarming up\n the caches took more time. This led to even worse\n tail latencies\n.\nFurthermore, our business experiences daily traffic peaks during the typical lunch and dinner hours, necessitating rapid autoscaling. But it took \n~10 minutes\n for a new replica to be ready for querying.\nLastly, manual handling was required for master failovers, which resulted in low data indexing \nreliability\n and \nfault tolerance\n.\nSolving for scale: Moving to SolrCloud architecture\nThe logical solution to this problem was to divide the index into smaller segments and perform queries across multiple segments to address application requests. This approach led us to SolrCloud architecture, which allows managing large indexes in a more efficient and scalable manner, while still being self-managed. We observed several improvements:\nWe were able to run the cluster on smaller machines resulting in ~\n75% \nreduction in individual instances\u2019 \nCPU\n and \nMemory\n requirements.\nWe observed significant improvement in average and \ntail latencies\n.\nSmaller index per shard also improved \nscale-up \ntime by \n~20%\n.\nImproving the SolrCloud Performance\nCustom sharding logic\u00a0\nTo make sure that the migration to Solr Cloud is more performant, we developed a custom data-sharding strategy that aligns with \nZomato\u2019s hyperlocal business model\n, ensuring that data from a specific locality is stored within the same shard. As a result of this strategy, ~\n95% \nof queries were processed using a single shard, significantly reducing processing time and improving efficiency. The remaining queries were handled by multiple shards, providing an effective solution for handling a small subset of queries.\u00a0\nTurning off distributed search\nAt the time of splitting data into the shards, we ensured that we always knew which locality\u2019s data was present in which shard. This made it possible to turn off the \ndistributed search\n by directing requests to the relevant shard and ensuring that the replica receiving the request would return the response by querying its local index only.\nshards=shard1\nshard.preference=local\nBy combining our understanding of customer behaviour with Solr\u2019s internal request routing mechanisms, we successfully decreased the throughput on individual nodes by ~75%. Consequently, this reduction led to lower latency, decreased network traffic, and minimize costs, as the same traffic was served by a smaller number of nodes.\nSolving for resiliency and availability\nFollowing our successful migration from Solr Master-Slave to SolrCloud architecture, operations appeared to be running seamlessly. However, one day we started receiving alerts highlighting the absence of healthy hosts in one of the shards. This single-shard malfunction led to considerable downtime during peak business hours. At our operational scale, such downtimes result in substantial business losses and affect our customers, restaurant partners, and delivery partners alike.\u00a0\nThe Downtime\nSharing a few details about our self-managed SolrCloud setup and the pre-conditions which triggered the downtime:\nThe Solr clusters were hosted on \nSpot instances\n which means that running nodes can go down anytime.\nWe had configured to use only\n \nNRT (Near Real Time) replicas out of the \nthree available options\n i.e. NRT, TLOG and PULL replicas.\nWhenever a new replica joins the cluster, a unique, monotonically increasing number (znode) is assigned by ZooKeeper. During the Leader Election process, the replica with the smallest value is given a chance to become the leader.\nAfter a replica is allowed to become a leader, it verifies its index version proximity with the most recent version compared to the other replicas in the cluster. If its version is significantly outdated, it forfeits the chance of becoming the leader and goes into recovery, giving a chance to the next replica in the sequence.\u00a0\nAfter the leader is elected, any replica nodes significantly behind the new leader enter recovery mode to sync their index with the newly elected leader.\nIf any replica goes into recovery, it does not serve even the read traffic.\nNow, what actually happened at the time of the incident:\nThe leader instance got reclaimed, and hence the cluster had no active leader.\nA few minutes before the actual leader went down, a new replica joined the shard. Therefore, it had the most recent copy of the index.\nUnder these special circumstances, all the nodes in that shard went into recovery as their indexes were relatively older compared to the new replica and finally, the new replica was invited to become the leader.\nThe entire read traffic got redirected to the new leader. At the same time, all other replicas were trying to download GBs of data from the leader node. This led to a vicious cycle where the shard was not able to become healthy due to excess load on one node.\nFinally, we had to cut all the traffic (single shard and cross-shard requests both) to allow it some time to become healthy.\nSwitch to TLOG and Pull Replicas\nAt Zomato, we believe that \u201c\nOnly the Paranoid Survive\n\u201d. After finishing the RCA of the incident, we decided that we need to solve a few things:\nThe Solr cluster must be \nhighly available\n for processing the read queries by serving the read traffic during the Leader election or without any leader at all.\nWe should be able to \nquickly scale up\n the cluster without putting too much stress on the leader.\nWe decided to deep dive into Solr\u2019s replication and leader election process. Each replica type has a different way of processing the updates from the leader, which decides the series of events during the Leader Election:\nNRT\n:\nEach replica receives the update from the leader and writes data to the transaction log (tlog).\nUpdates are periodically flushed from the tlog to the index and stored in the disc. This also means that the \nindex files can be completely different\n (highlighted in Figure 2 as\n Idx\n1\n \nand \nIdx\n2\n) in each replica.\nNRT replica is eligible to become a leader during the leader election process.\nIn order to avoid any data loss, these replicas can go into recovery during the leader election.\nTLOG\n:\nEach replica receives the update from the leader and writes data to the transaction log but does not write changes to the local index.\nThe index is periodically updated by fetching only the incremental changes from the leader. This also means that the index files will be the same as that of the leader.\nTLOG replicas are also eligible to become a leader and just like NRT replicas, they can go into recovery during leader election to ensure data availability.\nPULL\n:\nPULL replicas do not receive any updates directly from the leader and hence do not maintain a transaction log.\nSimilar to TLOG replicas, the index is periodically updated by fetching only the incremental changes from the leader.\nPULL replicas are not eligible to become leader during the leader election.\nKeeping all of this in mind, we began trying out multiple combinations of replicas and recreated multiple scenarios and we observed that:\nNRT and PULL\n replicas [Not Recommended]\nDuring leader election, only the NRT replicas go into recovery. The cluster is able to serve read requests by PULL replicas at all times (even without a leader).\nNo benefit of Near Real Time searching even after having NRT replicas as PULL replicas reflect changes only after the NRT leader commits changes to the index.\u00a0\nSince each replica has its own copy of index files, in case of Leader Election,\u00a0 the follower replicas need to download the entire index from the new leader and discard their old index files. This leads to a lot of disk IO and network bandwidth wastage and puts the leader under stress.\nTLOG\n replicas\nAs mentioned earlier, the cluster goes into recovery for a short period of time during the Leader election process. Hence, the cluster will not be available for reads for that period.\nNRT and TLOG\n replicas [Not Recommended]\nBehave the same way as NRT and PULL replicas combination hence the same limitations and advantages.\nTLOG and PULL\n replicas\nDuring the leader election, only the TLOG replicas go into recovery and need to download only the incremental changes from the new leader.\nSimilar to the NRT and PULL combination, the cluster is able to serve read requests by PULL replicas even without a leader or during the leader election process.\nThe downside is that the cluster loses the capability of Near Real-Time Search.\nFinally, we went ahead with the \ncombination of TLOG and PULL replicas\n as we can bear some delay in reflecting the updates but we need the Solr cluster to be highly available for querying.\nExtra Miles \u2013 seeding index data for faster scaling\nWhenever a new node comes up, it has to download the entire index from the leader. This process has a serious limitation as it leads to bandwidth issues in case a lot of replicas need to be created at the same time.\u00a0\nWe tried to look for solutions and sought help from the Solr community, but we eventually decided to build a custom solution:\nPeriodically take a snapshot of the index and save it in the AWS S3.\nWhenever a new node comes up, it first downloads the latest snapshot from S3.\nConfigure the replica\u2019s \ndataDir\n \nto the path where the index is downloaded. This makes it possible to seed the index data for any new replica.\nAfter this, the replica downloads only the incremental changes from the leader, allowing us to scale 100s of replicas at the same time.\nThis solved one more problem for us. Currently, Solr offers \nbackup and restore\n functionality for each collection, and it creates a single backup for the index data across all shards. Our solution enabled us to restore a specific shard by simply creating a TLOG replica using the seed data stored in S3. This effectively functions as a point-in-time recovery mechanism for individual shards, adding an extra layer of flexibility and resilience to our SolrCloud infrastructure.\nIn Conclusion\nThe spirit of being always paranoid, clubbed with a deeper understanding of our business and the underlying technology, continuously pushes us to build scalable, resilient and highly available solutions for customers. Our journey with Apache Solr has been an interesting one and full of learnings and we look forward to regularly sharing this with the community.\nThis blog was written by \nNikhil Mishra\n in collaboration with \nSaurav Singh\n.\nSources:\nJava Garbage Collection\n, \nhttp://www.oracle.com\nIndex Replication\n, \nsolr.apache.org\nQuery Settings in SolrConfig\n, \nsolr.apache.org\nDistributed Requests\n, \nsolr.apache.org\nSpot instances\n, docs.aws.amazon.com\nShards and Indexing Data in SolrCloud\n, \nsolr.apache.org\nLeader Election\n, \nsolr.apache.org\nDataDir and DirectoryFactory in SolrConfig\n,\n solr.apache.org\nMaking and Restoring Backups\n,\n solr.apache.org"

        "content": "In \nour previous blog post\n, we talked about the challenges we faced due to the suboptimal design of our schema, which heavily relied on dynamic fields for fulfilling our requirements. This inturn, caused poor performance and high costs during peak times as we scaled up. While we implemented some quick fixes to address these issues, such as upgrading Solr version and utilizing doc_values for aggregate and sort fields, our dependency on dynamic fields remained a bottleneck when expanding the schema for new use cases.\nContinuing our journey towards a more robust and scalable data indexing system, in this blog post, we will dive deeper into the changes we made to our schema and query paradigm. These changes not only helped us achieve greater resiliency, scalability, and cost-effectiveness but also enhanced our overall performance, ensuring a seamless user experience. So, let\u2019s explore how we tackled these challenges and improved our search system.\nDynamic Fields \u2013 The Proposition\nDynamic fields offer a practical function by enabling the addition of various fields in a document, tailored to meet specific use cases. With this feature, we can create fields customized to the unique requirements of our data without having to modify the schema. For instance, we may need to store popularity values for different delivery areas of a Restaurant. To achieve this, we could use a dynamic field such as popularity_* to accomplish the task. During indexing, we can enrich the restaurant document with popularity values for its various delivery locations.\nAn example of a Restaurant with its popularity values at different delivery locations:\n{\n    'id': 'res1',\n    'entity': 'restaurant',\n    'name': 'Dynamic Pizza Store',\n    'location': '89.998900, 28.8389300',\n    // popularity score for different delivery areas\n    'popularity_area1': 0.93,\n    'popularity_area2': 0.25,\n    'popularity_areaN': 0.71\n}\nIn the case of Zomato, where a single restaurant can deliver at multiple locations, the number of unique popularity_{area_id} fields can quickly accumulate, especially when considering all the restaurants in India. This scenario is just one of the many examples that can cause a substantial increase in the total number of unique fields. Furthermore, the system comprises of various document types, each with its own set of dynamic fields, which can exacerbate the issue, resulting in a field mapping explosion. This situation can lead to out-of-memory errors and make recovery difficult. Moreover, the high field count can also adversely affect full indexing speed. Using dynamic fields, even if it\u2019s one of the most conventional design patterns, for \nunbounded\n fields, is not a scalable or sustainable solution in the long run.\nAn experiment to revisit the Restaurant popularity score which needs to be A/B tested in production will introduce another dynamic field like \npopularity_v2_*\n or extend the existing field, in either approach such experiments will increase the unique field counts by hundreds of thousands.\nUsecase & Alternative Model\nFiltering, sorting, or aggregating documents, such as restaurants or dishes, based on various fields like popularity, location, rating, and cost, is a practical use case. While these fields are mostly global, they may not always be sufficient for every use case. Zomato, being a hyperlocal heavy business, requires more granular values for entities to be relevant to specific use cases. For example, a dish like \nChole Bhature\n may be more popular in \nDelhi\n than in \nKolkata\n. Moreover, the popularity or demand for a dish may vary significantly within a city. For instance \nSushi\n may be more popular in the Golf Course area of Gurugram as against the lanes of Old Gurugram. In such cases, the global properties of an entity might not be enough, and more granular values are needed to find the most relevant results. Hence having granular and localized information available during indexing is crucial for enhancing search relevance and speed. For instance, if a restaurant has popularity scores for various delivery locations, incorporating that information at index time would be beneficial. Although Dynamic Fields appear to be the logical choice to index such information alongside other properties, the unbounded or high cardinality of such properties can lead to a mapping explosion.\u00a0\nAn alternative model for the above example could be as follows:\n{\n    'id': 'res1',\n    'entity': 'restaurant',\n    'name': 'Dynamic Pizza Store',\n    'location': '89.998900, 28.8389300',\n    // popularity score as map\n    'popularity': {\n        'area1': 0.93,\n        'area2': 0.25,\n        'areaN': 0.71\n    }\n}\nThe above structure assumes that popularity can be indexed as a Map data type and that the map contains the popularity value of different areas. This approach seems more concise and intuitive and avoids dynamic field popularity_*. However, Solr does not support such a field type out of the box. Although we could store a custom field type or serialized map data, it would not efficiently filter, sort, or aggregate data on such granular properties. We cannot use the data indexed in the above format to filter restaurants serving in areaX and order them by their popularity in that area. This would have been possible, if Solr magically supported the query pattern to filter on popularity.areaX != 0 and sort by popularity.areaX, unfortunately that\u2019s not the case.\nNested Documents Rationale\nEven though Solr cannot index and query a field as a Map, it does support nested documents and facilitates efficient indexing and \nretrieval\n of them, according to the Solr \ndocumentation\n:\nNested documents in Solr can be used to bind a blog post (parent document) with comments (child documents)\u2009\u2014\u2009or as a way to model major product lines as parent documents, with multiple types of child documents representing individual SKUs (with unique sizes/colours) and supporting documentation (either directly nested under the products or under individual SKUs.\nIn the nested document model, the above example can be represented as follows:\n{\n    'id': 'res1',\n    'entity': 'restaurant',\n    'name': 'Dynamic Pizza Store',\n    'location': '89.998900, 28.8389300',\n    // popularity score as the list of nested objects\n    'popularity': [\n        {\n            'id': 'res1_area1',\n            'entity': 'popularity',\n            'value': 0.93\n        },\n        {\n            'id': 'res1_area2',\n            'entity': 'popularity',\n            'value': 0.25\n        },\n        {\n            'id': 'res1_areaN',\n            'entity': 'popularity',\n            'value': 0.71\n        }\n    ]\n}\nFurther research revealed that the Nested document model is \nNOT\n a construct at the Lucene level. Solr has gone beyond the simple document structure that Lucene recognizes by abstracting this concept. Solr uses the following fields to maintain relationships between the document entities:\n_root_ : automatically populated in all the docs (root, parent, child) of a hierarchy, contains the value of root document ID\n_nest_path_\n : \nautomatically populated in non-root docs, contains the path of the document in the hierarchy\n_nest_parent_ : automatically populated for the docs with its immediate parent ID if exists\nIn order to ensure that the fields mentioned above are populated, the schema must have them defined in a specific manner, and it is \nnot optional\n:\n<field name=\"_root_\" stored=\"false\" type=\"string\" indexed=\"true\"/>\n<fieldType name=\"_nest_path_\" class=\"solr.NestPathField\" />\n<field name=\"_nest_path_\" type=\"_nest_path_\"/>\n<field name=\"_nest_parent_\" stored=\"true\" indexed=\"true\" type=\"string\"/>\nBy including the fields mentioned above in the documents, Solr can determine the \nrelationships\n between the documents, which allows for the hierarchical indexing, updating, or deleting of a group of documents at the same time. For instance, it can index an entire Restaurant document with all of its Dishes and area Popularity documents together. Indexing the relationships between documents typically leads to \nfaster\n queries than performing an equivalent \njoin\n at query time because the relationships are already stored in the index, which eliminates the need to calculate them. As a result, Solr can respond to queries more quickly. Since the concept of Nested documents is an abstraction in Solr, all child documents are ultimately standalone documents. This has some nuances for the schema definition.\nA field can be configured in one way only, no matter what sort of documents are using it\nIt may be infeasible to use required restrictions on the fields, since\u00a0 not all documents will have all the fields\nWhat all changed?\nThe implementation of a nested structure has resulted in a single document (like Restaurant) being divided into multiple documents (like Restaurants and its Popularity and Dishes), forming a hierarchical relationship that allows for the entire hierarchy to be accessed at once. Multiple \nsmall\n documents are used to replace dynamic fields, resolving the issue of mapping explosion. While this approach leads to a significant increase in the number of individual Lucene-level documents, we have not encountered any problems dealing with this tradeoff. Although there is a slight increase in index size, the indexing speed has \nimproved\n significantly due to the absence of the mapping explosion. To efficiently query this new structure, we migrated our queries to the \nBlock Join Query Parser\n (\nBJQ\n), which can effectively search the nested structure using relationships.\nBlock Join Query Paradigm\nTo ensure efficient searching within the nested document construct, queries must incorporate the relationship between the parent and child documents. By utilizing these relationships, various access patterns can be established, of which there are two primary ones.\nChild Query\n \u2013 A \nquery\n that matches some parent documents and returns the children of those documents\nq={!child of=<blockMask>}<someParents>\nParent Query\n \u2013 A\n query\n that matches child documents and returns their parents\nq={!parent which=<blockMask>}<someChildren>\nblockMask\n here is to identify the set of document which should be treated as parents\nTo summarize, Block Join Queries (BJQ) can be used to query nested documents by filtering either the parent documents based on the attributes of their children or the child documents based on the attributes of their parents. In the specific use case of a Restaurant with Dishes and Popularity as children, BJQ can be used to find Restaurants (parents) that serve a certain Dish (child) using the Parent Query Parser. It can also be used to find all the Dishes being served by Restaurants in a particular area by filtering Restaurants with a popularity score in that area. The possibilities for using BJQ are immense and can be leveraged for a variety of use cases. More information can be found in the official \nSolr BJQ\n documentation.\nEnd Note\nWe faced limitations in adding more dynamic fields, which led to delays in implementing some business use cases. To overcome these limitations, we changed the schema paradigm and migrated most of our use cases to the Nested Document model. We also changed our queries to efficiently query the new structure using BJQ. While the Nested Document model does increase the index size slightly, we experienced faster indexing speeds due to the reduced unique field counts. Overall, these changes were successful in addressing our challenges with dynamic fields.\nWay Ahead\nThe migration to a nested structure effectively resolved the immediate issue and ensured future compatibility with various use cases. However, as the number of restaurants on the platform continues to grow and more delivery locations are added, there is an increasing number of child documents associated with each parent. While this is not a problem from a query perspective, as the relationship between parents and children is established during index time, the size of the index has grown over time. As a result, maintaining the entire index on a single machine in a Master-Slave setup is no longer a viable option.\u00a0\nIn the next blog post, the last in this series, we will delve into our decision to transition to a Solr Cloud setup and the performance and production issues associated with it.\nKeep coming back for more!\nThis blog was written by \nSaurav Singh\n.\nSources:\nSearching Nested Documents\n, solr.apache.org\nNested Document indexing\n, solr.apache.org\nJoin Query Parser\n, solr.apache.org\nBJQ\n, solr.apache.org\nChild Query Parser\n, solr.apache.org\nParent Query Parser\n, solr.apache.org"

        "author": "Zomato Engineering",
        "content": "Whether you are craving a piping hot pizza or a scrumptious biryani, customers can find their desired dishes effortlessly with just a few clicks. But have you ever wondered what serves as a backbone to all Search features available on the Zomato app and website?\nProviding the correct and specific search results to our customers becomes the most basic criterion to ensure a good user experience. With the ability to handle an unlimited number of inputs, our search system is responsible for powering 100+ millions of search queries every day. On Zomato, Solr-Lucene is the base of all search functions and solves some of the use cases most important to us \u2013 restaurant and reviews search, cuisine search, sorting and grouping of restaurants and cuisines based on rating, search score, and much more.\nSo, why do we choose Solr for such use cases?\nSolr is an open-source, enterprise-level search platform built on Apache Lucene, which is a highly popular and widely used library for search-related applications. It has gained trust and popularity among various well-known technology companies, which is a testament to its reliability, scalability, and robustness. This popularity has led to a thriving community of developers and users, making it easier for developers to find support and resources when needed. Additionally, the well-known Elasticsearch engine is also based on the Lucene library.\nScale \u2013 Performance & Cost!\nInitially, everything functioned seamlessly, but as we experienced substantial growth in recent years, some of our assumptions failed at scale. One Solr node could not manage the high traffic volume, and the servers resulted in frequent Out of Memory (OOM) errors as we increased the traffic. The OOM issue became a bottleneck and required a larger cluster to handle peak traffic, leading to a substantial increase in server cost. This emphasizes the need for thoughtful consideration of cost implications when making technology decisions, particularly for high-traffic applications like Zomato.\nOOM, Why?\nThe Out of Memory (OOM) issue on our Solr setup was caused by several factors. Solr runs as a Java process, which has a Garbage Collector (GC) that runs at a certain frequency to clean up non-referenced objects and free up memory for further use. However, in this case, GC was struggling to reclaim memory from the Old Gen Heap space, causing the space to grow until it reached an OOM state, resulting in the process being killed. We also observed that the Heap shrinks back to the normal size after it syncs data from the Master Machine.\u00a0\nWe run some of the Solr clusters in a Master-Slave setup, where the Master machine handles indexing (write) and the Slave machines sync data from the Master at a certain frequency. The Slave machines manage the Query (read) traffic behind a load balancer.\nDespite tweaking the JVM parameters and memory settings, the instances continued to go OOM even with constant traffic. \nJVM monitoring\n and Heap analysis led to the discovery that the size of the caches maintained by Solr was the root cause of the issue, which was confirmed through the Solr Admin Dashboard as well. One of these caches, the \nField Cache\n, was growing without limits, and it was uncovered that the Field Cache cannot be configured to limit its maximum size or count in general.\nWhat is Field Cache?\nField cache is a crucial component of the Solr search engine, which enables fast and efficient \nsorting\n, \ngrouping\n, and \nfaceting\n on fields. Solr uses the Field Cache to store the field values of all the filtered documents so that it can quickly access them when needed. This is necessary because when fields are scanned, the process of iterating through all the documents and loading each document\u2019s fields can be slow and resource-intensive, resulting in multiple disk seeks.\nSolr gradually un-inverts and puts the data into the Field Cache at search time, which creates an in-memory \ncolumn-oriented\n view of documents that makes these types of queries much faster. However, the Field Cache is not configurable and does not support auto-warming, which means if the cache is purged (\nafter syncing with the master\n), the aggregation query performance will be impacted.\nFrom Doc level stored info\n{\n    'DocX': {'A':1, 'B':2, 'C':3},\n    'DocY': {'A':2, 'B':3, 'C':4},\n    'DocZ': {'A':4, 'B':3, 'C':2}\n}\nTo Field level cached info - Field Cache\n{\n    'A': {'DocX':1, 'DocY':2, 'DocZ':4},\n    'B': {'DocX':2, 'DocY':3, 'DocZ':3}\n}\nAnother issue with Field Cache is that if there is no limit on the number of such fields, the cache can grow indefinitely over time, making it even more resource-intensive. The \nDynamic Field\n in Solr is one such construct that theoretically makes the overall number of fields unlimited across all the documents, which can be dangerous for applications using Solr if they have aggregation queries on such fields.\nElasticsearch, on the other hand, limits the total number of fields to 1000 in its default setting, which it calls \u201c\nmapping explosion\n\u201c. Unfortunately, Dynamic Fields resulted in a higher number of fields, exceeding far beyond 1000, in some of our use cases.\nPossible fixes & nuances\nIn our setup, Slave instances pull data from the Master instance at a specific frequency. If there is no change in the index version on the Master instance, the Slave will not pull anything and the caches won\u2019t be purged as there is no data update. To ensure that there is always an update on the Master machine, we started indexing a \nMock document\n at regular intervals that is shorter than the sync interval. This ensures that the Slave gets an updated index version and eventually ends up purging its caches at regular intervals.\nWhile this approach was a lifesaver, it ended up impacting the response time and causing higher CPU usage due to cache auto-warming for other caches and the complete rebuilding of the Field Cache at query time. The constant purging of the cache saved the Slaves from OOM errors, but it drastically limited the throughput of a single Slave node. As too many requests increase the memory usage, it results in OOM well before the Slave can even sync data from the Master. Moreover, syncing too frequently would not only harm the response time but would also consume a lot more CPU and memory resources.\nThe Right Fix \u2013 DocValues\nThe main objective was to increase throughput while keeping memory usage to a minimum and eliminate the Out of Memory (OOM) error. The biggest challenge was the growing Field Cache caused by sorting/grouping queries and multiple dynamic fields. The solution was to adopt \nDocValues\n, a way of storing field values that is more efficient for sorting and faceting than traditional indexing. DocValues use a column-oriented approach with a document-to-value mapping built at \nindex time\n, which reduces memory requirements and makes lookups faster. Like other index files, DocValues are \nloaded\n into memory using \nMMapDirectory\n, which relies on the operating system to load the relevant data into RAM instead of the JVM, thereby avoiding OOM issues. Enabling DocValues is straightforward, simply use docValues=\n\u201ctrue\u201d\n<field name=\"field_name\" type=\"string\" indexed=\"false\" stored=\"false\" docValues=\"true\" />\nDocValues \u2013 Solved Problems\nDocValues create un-inverted data at index time. With un-inverted data, queries are more efficient and faster, reducing the overhead of un-inversion at runtime. This has also eliminated the problem of the ever-growing FieldValue cache, making the system more scalable and resilient to increasing traffic. The results of this optimization have been remarkable, with a whopping \n10x increase\n in \nthroughput\n per Slave node. This was rigorously load tested in a real-world production scenario and worked flawlessly. The reduced cluster size also resulted in significant cost savings across multiple Solr clusters used for various use cases, cutting the costs by approximately \n80%\n, close to \u20b9\n30L\n per month.\nDocValues \u2013 Issues\nThere were some issues with DocValues when dealing with Dynamic Fields, particularly with data \nsparseness\n and slow indexing processes. Dynamic fields, when defined as DocValues, can result in sluggish segment merge during indexing and optimization processes if they are present in a limited number of documents. The indexing process became time-consuming because of the inefficient handling of \nDynamic Field Explosions\n. This was due to the DocValues producers and consumers that used iterators to travel through every single document for each DocValue field, regardless of its presence in a single document or all documents. This issue was reported in improvement ticket \nLUCENE-7253\n which later got fixed in the \nLucene-7.0.0\n major version upgrade, where the iterator only traveled through documents with a non-empty value for a given field. There were further issues specific to our use cases for which we forked the Solr-Lucene repo and added fixes, and updated unit test cases for them.\nBased on these improvements, we decided to upgrade our cluster from \nv6.x\n to \nv7.6.0\n, and the results were fantastic. The \nindexing\n speed was at-par, \nlatency\n was reduced, \ncache\n hits improved, \nresiliency\n was drastically improved, and the overall \ncost\n was lower compared to the previous state. Further upgrades to some of our clusters to \nv8.7.0\n have also shown the same positive results, and the improvements continue to work flawlessly.\nAfterword\nWhen it comes to optimizing Solr performance, every use case is unique and requires experimenting with various configurations, including JVM and cache settings. Choosing the right schema to index data can also have a significant impact on performance, as it helps to improve query speed, reduce index size, and minimize memory usage during runtime. Another crucial aspect is adjusting Solr cache parameters, which can greatly improve search latencies and minimize memory requirements. Writing efficient queries is also crucial for maximizing cache hits, but that falls outside the scope of this discussion. When dealing with faceting (aggregations) and sorting queries, using DocValues is the best option as it reduces memory footprint and minimizes the risk of memory leaks. Finally, it\u2019s important to note that Solr performs best with a relatively static index, so it\u2019s best to avoid frequent syncing with the master node, depending on the use case.\nMore to come\nDocValues and other fixes addressed the issue, but the underlying problem of Mapping Explosion remained. In future articles, we will explore how to overcome Dynamic Field explosion in inappropriate scenarios and the reasons behind our migration to Solr Cloud architecture for some clusters.\nThis blog was written by \nSaurav Singh\n.\nSources:\nJVM Monitoring\n, docs.oracle.com\nDynamic Field\n, solr.apache.org\nMapping explosion\n, elastic.co\nDocValues\n, solr.apache.org\nDocValues loading\n, github.com\nMMapDirectory\n, lucene.apache.org\nLUCENE-7253\n, issues.apache.org\nLucene-7.0.0\n, lucene.apache.org"

To manage their procurement costs, restaurants tend to buy in bulk \u2013 a large part of the cost advantage gets lost in wastage, lower yields (due to inconsistent quality), and even pilferage.\nOn-time delivery of ingredients, especially fresh ingredients, is a challenge.\n As a result, restaurants have to waste the early hours of their operations on vendor and on-route coordination.\nScaling the business with these challenges is a herculean task. We wanted to solve this so that the restaurants could dedicate their time in doing what they know best \u2013 creating excellent gastronomical experiences.\nHow Hyperpure works?\u00a0\nOperating in 10 cities, our farm-to-fork model currently provides next-day delivery on a wide range of quality ingredients\n \u2013 staples, packaged and frozen products, fresh fruits and vegetables, poultry, meats & seafood, sustainable packaging, and ready-to-serve products.\u00a0\nAnd while we are up to the mark on speed, we also want to ensure full control on the quality of the ingredients. Hyperpure has established large warehouses across each city to manage end-to-end delivery to restaurants\u2019 doorsteps.\nThe idea is to make day-to-day tasks easier for restaurants \u2013 no matter how different they are. We work closely with our partners to learn and understand their growth plans, scale, and challenges. Our dedicated team of managers, category specialists, and culinary experts work closely with restaurants to determine the right path for their growth journeys.\nHelping restaurants grow\u00a0\nAs restaurants look to scale, three things become important for them to master \u2013 consistency in the quality of raw materials, complete visibility and control of food costs, and kitchen productivity. Here\u2019s how we help restaurants with these \u2013\u00a0\nWith restaurant operations at our core, we are always looking to go the extra mile to enable restaurants and the industry at large, to grow rapidly and consistently. Below is an example of how we helped a restaurant partner increase their revenue by switching to Hyperpure \u2013\nWhat\u2019s next?\nAt present, we serve over 30,000+ restaurants across 10 cities and partner with restaurants of all sizes \u2013 from food entrepreneurs just getting started to well-grown large food chains. We strive to provide the best products to restaurants and make their life easier through our small and big interventions, sustainably.\u00a0\nAnd as we grow, we look forward to implementing innovative and sustainable solutions. For example, we recently added an option to let restaurants opt out of getting paper invoices. Small action, but can have a significant environmental impact.\u00a0\nRecently, we have also started hydroponic farming. Cultivating crops without using soil will not only help us produce more harvest from the lesser area but will also reduce the carbon emission it takes in transporting fruits and vegetables from villages to cities.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat\u2019s all for now. We hope to update you all soon on new things brewing at Hyperpure. Stay tuned!"

        "author": "Communications Team",
        "content": "What do you say when someone asks you why are you participating in a Hackathon? Saying that you\u2019ve come to a hackathon for (free) food is not the ideal response, and more so to a CEO.\u00a0\nIt was a Saturday morning, and I was in the Zomato headquarters for a hackathon. Our team was working in one of the many glass meeting rooms when a serious-looking man in a black hoodie walked in and introduced himself, saying, \u201cHi, I\u2019m Deepi\u201d.\u00a0\nHearing this, one of my teammates said, \u201cI got it\u201d. I, on the other hand, was super confused. I thought, maybe, I heard \u2018DP\u2019, which is an acronym for \u2018delivery partner\u2019 at Zomato. I thought it was an internal joke I was unaware of. So, I just smiled and let it pass.\u00a0\nWe began talking about the project, and after sharing and receiving a few suggestions, the man in black asked, \u201cYahan kya karne aaye ho?\u201d, which loosely translates to \u201cwhat are you doing here?\u201d I mentioned the first (honest) thing that came to my mind, \u201ckhaana khaane\u201d, translating to \u201cto have food\u201d. And, we all had a hearty laugh.\u00a0\nShortly after he left, my teammate, who was smiling earlier, nudged me and said it was the founder you were speaking with. It took me a good ten minutes to let that sink in.\u00a0\nWell, this is one of the many unusual things that happened last weekend at the headquarters. Let\u2019s start from the beginning.\u00a0\u00a0\nA few weeks back, I was browsing through my LinkedIn feed and came across a post on \nHackaNoodle \n\u2013 a hackathon powered by Zomato & Blinkit, with a special focus on women and the trans community. A big fan of hackathons/coding competitions in general, I quickly opened the link to learn more about it and, soon after, registered my name.\u00a0\nSince HackaNoodle was scheduled for November, we all had a few days to form our teams. We made a team of four \u2013 \nRitika Patel\n, \nPalak Bansal\n, \nAkshit Sehgal\n, and me (\nNihal Gupta\n). We started meeting online on Zoom calls to brainstorm what we wanted to build. With Diwali and festive preparations, the days went by quickly. Finally, the much-awaited weekend was here.\nThe D-day\nOn November 5th, we all were standing outside a large building in Gurugram with a huge, red board on top reading \u2018Zomato\u2019. It did not feel like anything big until we stepped in. But oh, how it all changed as soon as I entered the office. I could feel the energy all around me \u2013 hundreds of coders, a lot of hustle, and the crew welcoming each of us. However, one thing that (pleasantly) surprised me was the number of women present there. We had 40+ teams, and all of them were led by women.\u00a0\nAt the gates, we all got our goodie bags. Like a child, I took my bag aside, found the nearest table, sat there and started unpacking everything one by one. There was a cool black hoodie with my name written on it (which I wore then and there), a laptop pad, a water bottle, stickers (special thanks to the person who included cool stickers in the goodie bag, I love pasting stickers on my laptop), and a few munchies.\u00a0\nOnce everyone settled in, the engineering team started briefing us on HackaNoodle \u2013 what it was, the theme, the judging criteria, and more. Here, we got to know how Zomato was founded because of a pizza craving Deepinder Goyal had 14 years back (now that I recall this, my answer does not sound dumb \u2013 food can take you places!). The story made us realise that we seldom remember how everything starts with a basic idea \u2013 be it a product or an organisation.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd we had 24 hours to think of that idea and build it from scratch.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd it began\u2026\nThe marathon started, and all teams got a room each to eat, sleep, code, and repeat!\nWe hurried to discuss what we should build. Since the theme was \u201cBuild India\u2019s Next Unicorn\u201d, we had many horizons to explore. The challenge was to pick out the best.\u00a0\nIn between our brainstorming sessions, the Zomato team came for check-ins. They mentored and brainstormed with us and gave us real-time suggestions. It felt great to work with such brilliant minds.\nCode, code, and more code\nOnce we finalised the idea, the rest of the day was packed with coding, caffeine, fixing bugs, and, yes\u2026 more caffeine.\u00a0\nWe continuously tested our code, scratched our heads, and pulled our hair out when the code was not working. But in the end \u2013 we made it work!\nFood scenes\nWhat kept us working all those long hours without snapping at each other was food. We were in Zomato\u2019s office, so no doubt the food arrangements had to be grand! Everything we needed \u2013 unlimited beverages, noodles, and munchies \u2013 was within an arm\u2019s distance. A great variety of dishes were served during every meal.\nIt felt like I was Charlie, and this was my chocolate factory.\u00a0\nThe showtime\nThe next morning, we had to showcase what we had built. On one side were the top leaders of Zomato and Blinkit, and on the other, a bunch of college students giving their 100% to make India\u2019s next big unicorn.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019ve ever been to a hackathon, you know how excruciating the pitching process can be. No matter how great your idea is, it\u2019s not worth it if you can\u2019t sell it. \nWe built a personal workout training application using AI\n that can track your body while you are performing any exercise or yoga. Our AI would provide feedback, and real-time analytics like posture correction, calories burnt, and activity time. In a nutshell, we were providing people with their own personal trainer, who is available at all times.\u00a0\nBefore selling it to others, we sold it to ourselves first. We practised our pitch again and again. And by the time we had the actual presentation, we felt super-prepared.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe results\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, we got the results. Gunjan Patidar (Chief Technology Officer, Zomato) announced that we made it to the top six. We now had to pitch the product to the audience, and they would vote to finalise the winners.\u00a0\nHere are the top three ideas that garnered the most votes (and for all the right reasons) \u2013\nA tool for advanced detection of dyslexic patients, built by Team \u2018The Noob Army\u2019\nGenerative art videos based on audio clips, created by Team \u2018Dining Philosophers\u2019\nAn e-commerce platform for differently-abled people, developed by Team \u2018Agile Coders\u2019\nIt was exciting to see these ideas unfold and witness the great power of tech \u2013 how it can solve so many problems when coupled with the right intent. Although we didn\u2019t win the hackathon, I consider myself extremely fortunate because we got a chance to brainstorm with top leaders and engineers, which was one heck of an experience. We built a useful product, secured a place in the top six, had loads of fun, met enthusiastic coders like us, had delicious food, and learnt a lot.\u00a0\nCan\u2019t thank Zomato and Blinkit enough for organising such a fantastic and memorable event!\u00a0\nThis blog is written by \nNihal Gupta\n \u2013 a B.Tech (CSE) student at Maharaja Surajmal Institute of Technology (MSIT) who came to the Zomato headquarters to participate in HackaNoodle\u201922 \u2013 a coding competition hosted by Zomato and Blinkit.\u00a0\n____\nThis is a personal blog.

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/tips-at-zomato/",
        "author": "Mohit Sardana",
        "content": "In the last couple of years, our Tech and Logistics teams have made significant changes to how tips work. From \nwhat it was\n, when we started the tipping feature on Zomato online ordering application back in 2019, we\u2019ve certainly come a long way. For one, now our delivery partners are notified immediately of a customer\u2019s generosity.\u00a0\nWhile we were rolling out these changes and diving deep into the world of tips in India, we learnt that, as a country, we\u2019re quite new to this habit. Here are a few facts that put it in perspective \u2013\nOne of the reasons that prevent people from tipping is that there exists an array of commonly-believed misconceptions. Out of these, the following two are the most widespread \u2013\nA lot of people think that the tips given via the Zomato platform are not transferred to delivery partners in full. A part of it is taken as convenience or platform fees\nTips are transferred to the bank accounts of delivery partners along with their monthly or weekly payout and not on the same day\nHowever, the truth can\u2019t be far from this. As an organisation, we are keen on improving the lives of delivery partners and helping them achieve their financial goals.\u00a0\nWhatever amount delivery partners get in tips, 100% of it is transferred to their accounts directly.\n In fact, we absorb all payment gateway charges, including administrative and convenience fees, to ensure tips remain 100% transferrable.\u00a0\nAs for the timeline, tips don\u2019t form a part of the weekly payouts. We transfer tips as and when they are received i.e., on an ongoing basis. Fun fact: of all the tips we get, we transfer ~80% of them to delivery partners\u2019 bank accounts within 60 minutes of receiving them.\u00a0\nAll in all, we credit 92% of the tips to delivery partners\u2019 accounts within 24 hours of delivery being completed. We are working with our banking partners to ensure we hit 100% here, at the earliest.\nCommunicating more\u00a0\nAs a platform connecting multiple stakeholders, our responsibility exceeds just developing better processes. We also need to build trust and transparency at every stage of our stakeholder journey \u2013 be it for our customers, restaurant partners or delivery partners. As the first steps towards this, we\u2019ve started sharing more information about our initiatives on the customer and delivery partner apps.\nFor instance, \non the customer app\n, we actively showcase why tips are more important during certain days (for instance, festivals, weekends, late-night deliveries, rainy season).\u00a0\nFun fact \u2013 While, on average, 5% of daily orders have a tip included in them, on Diwali \u2013 the number increased to 6.3%.\u00a0\nAs for\n the delivery partner app\n, we actively share more information with delivery partners regarding who tipped them, when they will receive it, and a notification when the amount is actually credited. Additionally, for the delivery partner to reciprocate gratitude, we have small nudges throughout the tip journey to thank customers, both online and offline.\u00a0\nCurrently, of all the delivery partners who get tips, ~88% of them click on the \u2018thank you\u2019 pop-up to show gratitude to customers.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s how it looks \u2013\u00a0\nOver the months, this communication has helped make the interaction between customers and delivery partners more pleasant.\nAnother step we\u2019re taking in this direction is making the overall process simpler. We understand that different customers have different preferences. While some like to pay tips in cash, others want online payment. One group likes to pay while placing an order, another one wants to do it only after receiving their order. To accommodate all these, we have made multiple flows on our customer app. Here is how this looks \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBonus fact \u2013 Customers find it a lot easier to tip while placing their order rather than later. Most of our tips \u2013 ~85% are added to the cart, and the remaining ~15% are initiated from the order tracking screen.\u00a0\nIn addition to this, we keep adding small nuggets to make the whole process fun, such as dynamic emojis on clicking the amount, an animated video showing a tipping jar, and more.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHope the article helped you learn more about tips. We will try to share more updates in the future on our new improvements. Till then, keep ordering (and tipping).\u00a0\nAll images and videos used are owned by Zomato, and are subject to copyright."

        "content": "The decision that changed it all!\nFour years back, in March 2018, something big was brewing in my life. Outside, it was a beautiful day \u2013 winters were finally going to rest, and spring was gradually taking its first breath. The roads were laden with new flowers, and people were basking in the sunshine that felt the right kind of warm.\u00a0\nOn the inside, however, I could feel a storm underway. I was shifting from Mumbai to Gurugram \u2013 my first time interacting with the northern part of our country. I grew up in Vijaywada, Andhra Pradesh; went to college in Kharagpur, West Bengal; and did a small career stint in Mumbai, Maharashtra, for two years.\u00a0\nThe move was one of those life-defining moments for me. I knew there would be a lot of change, but I was ready to give it my all. The idea of building the coolest startup in the country sounded way too exciting. After my interview with Arpit Dave, (co-founder of Runnr, a startup Zomato acquired in 2018), I knew I would be at the core of Tech that would redefine food delivery at Zomato.\u00a0\nThe initial years\nI joined Zomato in the Analytics Team working closely with Logistics \u2013 the team responsible for getting food orders delivered to the customer\u2019s doorstep through the vast network of 3,00,000+ delivery partners and the backbone of our food delivery business today. My job here was to improve the overall delivery partner experience.\nIn my first two weeks, I realised the problem statements I was looking to solve were not just new challenges, they were completely unique. Initially, I could not help but spend long hours working, and yet, I would not meet timelines. It was during this time I was asked to create a simulation product using python, which had to be replicated from the Go programming language. Since I came from an Economics background, it was difficult to understand anything that had code in it. This was a major challenge for me \u2014 codes seemed Latin to me. However, I was ready to learn Latin, if it came to that.\u00a0\nSo I started \u2013 first, by constantly asking engineers around me the very basic questions. How do things work, which language is used, how can I learn them, etc? And then, I put those learnings into action. After a few months, I finally shipped my first simulation, which signals our platform to deactivate localities where the predicted demand of orders would exceed available delivery partners (to fulfil these orders), thereby leading to a poor customer experience. Eventually, this simulation became the basis for the final product that was launched! My joy knew no bounds. This experience encouraged me to learn more and solve new problems. \u00a0\nMoving beyond my comfort zone\nBy the time I completed my first year, I had not only learnt the basics of all algorithms but was adept at the science behind Zomato\u2019s Logistics product. I started searching for problems around the logistics framework that could best be solved using data science. This was when I stumbled upon building a model to estimate the credit limits for each delivery partner. I built the model end-to-end, and in the journey, learnt how models could make everyday life simpler. Once you know how a model works, all you have to do is put in the right features, and ta-da, you have a structure in place that can be scaled and replicated easily.\nThis is how my love and appetite for data science, models and big data grew. Subsequently, I realised I wanted to extend my core towards machine learning. So one day, I went to one of the tech leaders here at Zomato and asked if I could move to the Data Science Team. Thanks to the model I built recently and Zomato\u2019s culture of letting people be driven by their passions, he instantly agreed.\u00a0\nFinding my calling\nWhile working in the Data Science Team, we had an inter-departmental meeting with the Risk Management Team to discuss how we can make food ordering and delivery safer for all our stakeholders \u2013 be it the customers, our delivery partners and the restaurant partners by identifying suspicious behaviour on the app. As we started working on this, we found a whole new rabbit hole. It was almost an awakening to the need to extend the scope further to stitch varied models to help reduce high-risk behaviours on the Zomato platform. And so, we expanded the scope of the Risk Management Team to many new areas \u2013 to use a wide range of app signals and behaviours to distinguish suspicious actors from genuine customers faster and more accurately.\nSome of the projects that came out of this team have also helped improve the overall delivery partner and customer experience. One such project was to identify and club unique addresses together as a signal for our risk models. Today, the Logistics team also uses the same model to modify addresses for more accurate locations. Now, fewer delivery partners need to call customers to figure out the exact delivery location.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOverall, my journey in the Risk Management Team turned out to be everything and more I ever wanted it to be \u2013 a place I now call my second home. A great set of problems to work on and the best of colleagues (who became friends). I got to know some of the best people in Z \u2013 \nRachna \nand \nAanchal\n. A trio that came together for work, but stayed together for the shared love of food and hanging out.\u00a0\nSumming it up\nI came to Zomato to discover the best of my professional capabilities but found way more. There\u2019s something unique about working with people who are always up for going the extra mile and building products with the mindset that they will last forever. It\u2019s here that I got to know how trusting people to do their best opens up so many growth avenues and that there will always be something more to dig into. In my four-year journey, I\u2019ve realised that at Zomato, the need for an answer is greater than the need for mystery.\u00a0\nEven after spending 1,500+ days, it seems like the journey has only begun, and I can\u2019t wait to find what\u2019s in store."

        "author": "Mohit Gupta",
        "content": "Certain cloud kitchen operations create and operate multiple brands that are serviced from the same kitchen. When done thoughtfully and professionally, it brings innovative and high-quality experiences to customers at relatively lower prices as it creates operational and cost efficiencies in the kitchen.\nIn the recent past, the statutory body \u2013 Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has also stated that cloud kitchen entities are free to operate multiple brands on a single FSSAI license (usually unique to a kitchen).\u00a0\nHowever, there are some exceptions to this. Such as some fly-by-night operators, who account for less than ~0.2% of registered kitchens, misuse this flexibility in law by creating innumerable brands from the same kitchen. These brands have little to no differentiation in the product offering; instead they confuse/cheat customers by creating a false perception of choice, while none of it actually exists. Most of the brands run by these operators also have terrible reviews and ratings on our platform. Such operators tarnish the reputation of the restaurant industry as a whole, hurting all of us in more ways than one.\u00a0\nWhy is this a bad customer experience?\u00a0\nThese operators often create multiple brands with very little differentiation in the actual product (dishes or the food experience itself) offered to customers. Additionally, managing multiple brands and cuisines is operationally complex, and unless done with the right SOP and oversight, this leads to high inconsistencies in food quality and hygiene.\u00a0\nAs shown in the graphs below, customers\u2019 average\u00a0delivery rating for these operators goes down as the number of brands from a single kitchen goes up. Similarly, % of customers who raise complaints goes up as the number of brands from a kitchen increases.\nWhat are we doing to address this?\nOver the last few weeks, we have been engaging with the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) and the other restaurant partners to formulate the right approach to curb these practices. It is imperative for us to work together to protect the good work done by so many professionally run restaurants and jointly create parameters to avoid the misuse of the aggregator platforms in such a blatant and abrasive fashion.\u00a0\nGoing forward, we are going to manually check any physical location which runs more than 10 brands out of a single location. While there is no exact science to the right number of brands, we believe that even the most organised outlets in the industry don\u2019t see operational benefits and customer trust in operating too many brands from a single kitchen.\u00a0\nWe will whitelist the restaurant partners that provide a great experience other than the operators mentioned above from this manual check so that they don\u2019t face delays while expanding the scope of their businesses.\u00a0\nIf you are a restaurant partner, and you don\u2019t make it to the whitelist, and you think that you serve very differentiated brands (more than 10) from your premises, please write to us at \nmultiple-listings@zomato.com\n. Our teams will review your proposed offering, kitchen space (is it large enough to host and do justice to multiple cuisines), historic customer experience on Zomato for your existing listings amongst other things. We will also collaborate with FSSAI at their request so that it helps our authorities.\nAdditionally, as the Indian customer is seeking more information about the origin of their food, we will also showcase the information of multiple brands linked to a kitchen on the restaurant\u2019s page on Zomato, in the spirit of transparency.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHere\u2019s how it will look on the app:\u00a0\nWhile we work with the restaurant industry to together raise awareness and quality of experiences brought to customers, we also realise the important role we play in safeguarding customer experiences. We will keep evolving our policies and guidelines such that a small fraction of bad actors do not spoil the pudding for all of us.\u00a0\n\u2014-\nA heartfelt thank you to \n@prstb\n, who highlighted this to us via his Twitter post a few weeks back. Thank you for helping us keep Zomato a trusted platform for all customers!"

While \u2018\nbetter food\u2019\n focuses on increasing customer love by helping them discover the best food options around them, \n\u2018for more people\u2019\n captures our endless endeavour to evoke this emotion in more people.\nWith the idea of serving more customers, we spoke with some of you to understand what makes you order food online. We learnt that many consider \n\u2018bahar ka khaana\u2019\n as an enjoyable alternative to home-cooked food. While we cherish the times you think of Zomato during celebratory occasions, we also believe food cooked outside our homes can be more than just an enjoyable indulgence. It can be consumed daily as well.\nWe also learnt that many of our customers seek healthy food options online but are yet to find an offering that serves them well. With this in mind, we set out to build an offering that serves an amazing assortment of healthy options around you, which you can consume on an everyday basis.\u00a0\nNow, we know there\u2019s a lot of information (\nand misinformation\n) floating around when it comes to healthy eating. To address this, we grouped together two teams that helped cut through the noise \u2013 the first team consisted of product managers who had had successful health-driven journeys by solely relying on outside food. The second team comprised some of the best nutrition experts in the country. The teams had one common mission statement \u2013 to make healthy eating enjoyable and accessible for our customers.\nThe result \u2013 Zomato\u2019s brand new Healthy section\nConsidering the term \u2018Healthy\u2019 resonates differently with different people, we\u2019ve built the new Zomato Healthy section to cater to a variety of needs:\nAn all-new range of filters for every dietary need: \nIf you are someone who knows \nexactly \nwhat each of your meals should look like, you\u2019ll love our new assortment of filters \u2013 High Protein, Low Calorie, Low Carbs, Low Fat, and High Fibre to name some.\nAll information in one place: \nIf you are someone who loves reading food labels, this one\u2019s for you. In this section, we share extensive information on the food you\u2019re consuming, from the calories it has to the number of macronutrients (Protein, Carbs, Fat, Fibre); you\u2019ll find all of it here.\u00a0\nGuilt-free indulgences:\n If you have a sweet tooth and like indulging in sweet indulgences, you\u2019ll love our Dessert options where you won\u2019t have to choose between sweetness and health, a true epitome of \u2018\ntaste bhi, health bhi\u2019.\n\u00a0\nVegan options: \nAdvocates of plant-based diets \u2013 there\u2019s something special for you too!\nWhat\u2019s more? Each dish you see in the Healthy section has been hand-picked by a team of nutritionists and prepared by some of the finest restaurants. You can now find interesting food options (beyond just salads!) to meet your health requirements.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nTo begin with, we have launched Healthy in 10 cities across India \u2013 Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune, Chandigarh, Chennai, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, and Kolkata. \nAs always, we will continue to learn through the journey \u2013 understanding how our customers\u2019 needs evolve and how best we can fulfil them.\u00a0\nWe hope you enjoyed this update.

        "author": "Data Science Team",
        "content": "Generally, domain-specific search systems are optimised for single intent type queries. For instance, at an e-commerce site selling electronics, it will pertain to items like mobiles, chargers, power banks, etc. For an apparel site, it would be around dresses, shirts, pants, etc.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor us at Zomato, it usually pertains to a dish, a restaurant, or a cuisine. Such as searching for \u2018a burger\u2019, \u2018Restaurant XYZ\u2019, or \u2018Chinese\u2019 and so on. However, at times, customers search for more than one item together or queries with complex searches such as \n\u2018burger from XYZ restaurant\n\u2019 or \n\u2018pizza under INR 200.\u2019\n In cases like these, search engines become more than just indexing entities.\u00a0\nThere is a lot of coding and decoding involved to help our customers find the right thing in the blink of an eye. And to make that possible, our techies have to take a step back and get in the shoes of the customers to understand how they behave \u2013 why they type what they type, what they look for, and what they expect the results to be.\u00a0\nAny typical search engine works in a two-step process \u2013\nFirst is the retrieval process (candidate set generation), i.e., finding relevant entities for a given query with maximum recall, and the\nThe second step is ranking the entities based on factors like entity popularity, and keyword affinity towards the fetched entity with high precision\nOur current retrieval system is heavily-dependent on lexically-based matches and other factors. If a customer searches for queries with multiple intents, our system ranks entities based on the lexical match. Below is an example of \nsuch a long tail query\n \u2013\nWith the introduction of voice search, many customers prefer speaking longer queries rather than typing them. Recently, we also introduced voice search on our platform and observed that a significant number of searches in many emerging cities (Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities in India) are being made using voice assistants.\u00a0\nHere are a few examples of natural language queries made using voice search \u2013\nGarlic Bread with cheese dip\u00a0\nXYZ Bakery chocolate cake\nAnda curry and roti\nKoi Achcha Sa Sabji Batao\nNon-veg restaurant in adarsh nagar\nPizza outlets near me\nChai and samosa\nBurger 150rs wala\nUnlike single-intent queries, long natural language searches involve a deeper understanding of items and optimising them to show relevant results.\u00a0 Now, this is where our Data Science team comes into the picture.\u00a0\nBefore we dive further to understand the science behind the data, let\u2019s understand what natural language search queries actually mean.\u00a0\nUnderstanding Natural Language Search\nNatural language search allows customers to speak or type into a device using their everyday language rather than keywords and even use complete sentences or phrases in their native language. The computer then transforms these queries into something it can understand before showing results on the screen.\u00a0\nOptimising Natural Language Search\u00a0\nWe start with understanding the customer\u2019s intent and the entities involved in the query.\u00a0\nFor example, consider the query \u2018\nXYZ outlet near me\n\u2019\nHere, the \nintent\n is \u2018\nnearest outlet\n\u2019\nEntity\n \u2013 \u2018\nXYZ\n\u2019\u00a0\nTo better gauge the intent, we segment search queries in one of the three functionalities as below \u2013\u00a0\nDish + Dish search\n \n\u2013\n \u2018\nChai and Samosa\u2019\n\u00a0\nRestaurant + Dish Search \u2013 \n\u2018\nXYZ ka Burger\u2019\nRestaurant/Dish + near me/ best/ irrelevant text \u2013 \n\u2018Pizza outlets near me\u2019\nMaking a new product flow\nAs our old search system only supported only single-intent queries, we added a new flow to incorporate multiple intents or single intent with some specifications.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s how the overall architecture looks like \u2013\nOur new process involves two steps \u2013\u00a0\nFor every query made, our model identifies the \u2018search query\u2019 and \u2018city/ location\u2019\nBased on this information, it returns the output, which can be one of the three categories \u2013\nMultiple Dish\nSearch\n \u2013 Queries where customers search multiple dishes with minor spelling variations. For example,\n\u2018Chai and samosa\u2019\n\u2018Thali lassi k sath\u2019\n\u2018Burger with cold drink\u2019\nDish and Restaurant combine search\n \u2013 Queries where customers search for a dish or multiple dishes from a specific restaurant. For example,\n\u2018XYZ ka burger\u2019\n\u2018\nSamosa chai palace\u2019\n\u2018\nPaneer pizza pizzeria place\u2019\u00a0\nRestaurant or Dish Search with specifications or irrelevant keywords\n \u2013 Queries where customers search for multiple information at once. In this case, we show all the related entities (dish and/ or restaurant) on the top.\u00a0\nFor instance, if a customer searches for \u2018best joe\u2019s pizza outlet near me\u2019, we show all results concerning pizza and joe\u2019s (restaurants with the same or similar name).\nUnderstanding challenges\n\u00a0\nUnavailability of labelled data\u00a0\nQueries involving more than one language\nSabse achha pizza\u00a0\nMakni dal k sath naan\nUsage of words with multiple meanings\nchirkutlal chole bhature \u2013\u00a0 (\u201cchirkutlal chole bhature\u201d \u2013 \nRestaurant\n)\nchirkutlal k chole bhature \u2013 (\u201cchirkutlal\u201d \u2013 \nRestaurant\n, \u201cchole bhature\u201d \u2013 \nDish\n)\nSpelling variations/ abbreviations/ aliases\nRajma rice or Rajma chawal, roomali roti or rumali roti\u00a0(here, both are valid dishes)\nOur solution \u2013 the quest to find an architecture that works the best\nEmbedding-based approaches are commonly used in natural language processing as they easily capture the semantic relationship among words. \nWord2vec by Google\n2\n is commonly used in various lower stream Natural Language Processing tasks. For the text representation, we used word2vec embeddings. We trained the word2vec from scratch on our data for domain adoption and to reduce the noise.\u00a0\nBut the major drawback of using word2vec is that it generates embeddings only for the words which are available in the vocabulary. Keeping the vocabulary of all possible words/ phrases is not a feasible solution. So along with word2vec, we used \nByte pair encoding (BPE)\n3\n embeddings. BPE is a subword tokenisation-based method that tokenises the words based on their occurrence.\u00a0\nOnce we have our text (customer query) representation, sequentiality plays a vital role in name entity recognition. Both deep learning-based models like Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and statistical models such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Conditional Random Field (CRF) are widely used. Both these methods are specialised for processing sequential data. We have taken a combination of both, more specifically bi-directional LSTM with CRF, inspired by this research paper on \nBidirectional LSTM-CRF Models for Sequence Tagging\n4\n.\u00a0\nOur architecture is computational, fast (even on CPU) and easy to scale for a large customer base.\nEvaluation of the new model \n\u00a0\nWe took the first step in improving the customer experience and expanding our search capability beyond the single intent query. Currently, the model is deployed for A/B testing and has an upside in the click-through rate.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nKeeping in mind the limited resources and latency to scale city-wise models for pan India, we plan to explore self-attention-based transformer models in our successive iterations.\nOur priority is to optimise search queries based on customers\u2019 needs. Currently, we deploy our NLS model for limited purposes and are planning to expand the model for the following use cases:\nMultiple sub-categories and dish attributes (ingredients/ style of cooking)\n\u2018Mawa\n wali gujiya\u2019\n\u2018Spicy\n dal\u2019\nSearch with a specific restaurant\u2019s address/ location\n\u2018Ma petite bakery, Galleria\u2019\nHandling price-sensitive queries\n\u2018hundred ke andar pizza\u2019\n\u2018\ncake 200 ke range mein\n\u2019\n\u2018\nBurger 150rs wala\n\u2019\n\u2018Sabse sasta pizza\u2019\nThat\u2019s all, folks!\nThis is a Data Science article to share how we built the Natural Language Search at Zomato.

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/powering-restaurant-ads-on-zomato/",
        "author": "Machine Learning Team",
        "content": "There\u2019s a popular saying that \n\u2018great ads are those which don\u2019t feel like ads\u2019\n. The statement holds true in every case, be it a television advertisement, a newspaper commercial, or a digital ad. In our case, it is the latter-most, wherein we show promoted restaurants to customers on our app.\u00a0\nAt Zomato, promoted restaurants are a part of the recommendation rails. These are either new restaurants looking to create brand awareness or existing ones wanting new people to try their food. Their idea is to showcase what they make the best \u2013 could be a great fusion dish they invented or an authentic recipe they\u2019ve perfected over the years. For restaurants, the aim is to make their customers happy and generate business through it. And for us, it is to make the search journey easier and faster for customers, so they can quickly discover food and restaurants they would highly like.\u00a0\nFor example, when you visit a restaurant and ask the waiter what they would suggest the best. They ask you certain questions like your preference (veg/ non-veg), your spice tolerance, your preferred taste (sour/ sweet) and then come up with suggestions based on it. We aim for the same thing \u2013 to suggest dishes and restaurants that are relevant and unique.\u00a0\nTo ensure that we feature what customers would highly like, we use machine learning to make better and more personalised suggestions. Through this blog, we discuss how we improved the relevance of promoted restaurants through an AI-powered model for a better customer experience while ensuring that the promoted restaurants get the right visibility.\nProblem Formulation\nBefore using machine learning, we used to use different heuristics and utility functions to rank promoted restaurants. This system, however, has certain limitations. It did not consider customer nuances like dish preferences, promo code sensitivity, dietary preferences (veg/ non-veg), and affordability. Also, important contexts like meal time and weekdays are overlooked.\nWe want to serve customers with recommendations that have these factors baked into them, i.e., to present restaurants that are most relevant for them.\nUnfortunately, experimenting with combinations of all the above factors that influence a customer\u2019s ordering behaviour is too time-consuming. And, developing a utility function for it is not possible. To solve this, we formulated the problem as a ranking problem in machine learning.\u00a0\nIn a typical ranking problem, we have a dataset of past sessions, where the customers are presented with a set of documents and their interactions are recorded. In our context, restaurants become the documents, and the customer and contextual features become the query. Based on this interaction, the model is trained to discover patterns related to what types of customers show positive interaction (click/ order) with what kind of restaurants. Each document (restaurant) is assigned a score directly proportional to its relevance for a given query.\nEvaluation\nAfter training and before taking the model live, comes the evaluation part. To evaluate a model, we decide on a few metrics to track our progress at every step in an offline setting.\nWe track Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Mean Ordered Rank to benchmark each iteration. These help us know how effectively and successfully we can lead our customers to what they are looking for. Before we move ahead, here is a brief on some of the terms we\u2019ll be using.\u00a0\nMean Reciprocal Rank\n \n(MRR)\nMean of reciprocal rank at which a customer clicks and places the order across different sessions. Higher MRR shows that clicks are coming from the top ranks of recommended restaurants.\nMean Rank\nMean of rank at which customer clicks and places the order, across different customer sessions. The lower the mean rank, the better it is.\u00a0\nFor example, if we show you 10 restaurants and the customer orders from the third one rather than the fifth, then it shows the recommendations are better.\u00a0\nAccuracy@N\n\u00a0\nHow many times has the clicked restaurant fallen in the top-N of recommendations? The higher the accuracy@N is, the better it is. We looked at Accuracy@1, Accuracy@5 and Accuracy@8 in our evaluations. For example, if you frequently order pizza, how often a restaurant like \nPizza by Loui (fictitious name) \nwill come in your top recommendations.\nOut-of-time data set\nIn our case, it refers to a test dataset, i.e., if we have trained a model on data between 1-10th of a month, then we test our predictions on data from 11-15th of the same month. We move ahead when the model exhibits adequate performance over these metrics on the out-of-time dataset.\u00a0\nApart from the metrics discussed above, we also closely monitor the qualitative evaluation of these results.\u00a0\nModelling\nWe have used Learn to Rank (LTR) \u2013 a technique that applies supervised machine learning to rank and solve problems related to personalisation and relevance.\nTypically in ranking algorithms, we have an input \u2013\nwhere, q corresponds to a query and d refers to a document.\u00a0\nAs discussed above, here, the query refers to the customer and context, and the document refers to the restaurant. The model predicts a relevancy score s, where\u00a0\nOnce we have the relevance of each document, we can sort i.e., rank the restaurants according to those scores.\nAmong several ranking strategies in ML literature, LTR seems to be the most promising tool. Over the years, LTR has evolved a lot and can be classified into three major categories: Pointwise, Pairwise, and Listwise. These approaches mainly differ in the number of documents you consider at a time in the loss function while training a model.\nPointwise: \nThe Pointwise approach reduces LTR problems to regression problems. It solves a prediction problem on a single document at a time to create a single numerical score for that document. However, the drawback is, while doing so, it does not consider the relative ordering between documents (in our case, the restaurants). This makes it less effective for our use.\u00a0\nPairwise:\n The Pairwise approach looks at a pair of documents at a time. Its main aim is to minimise the number of inversions between the pairs in ranking i.e., it tries to minimise the cases where we rank a lower document above a higher-rated document.\nListwise: \nWhile Pairwise looks at a pair of documents at a time, the Listwise approach looks at a list of documents at a time for calculating gradients. Listwise approach also considers ranking metrics like NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) or MAP (Mean Average Precision) and tries to optimise them and come up with optimal ranking scores.\nEssentially, the Pairwise and Listwise approaches consider relative ordering of restaurants i.e., if restaurant A is preferable to Restaurant B, the order (Restaurant A, Restaurant B) is correct, and the order (Restaurant B, Restaurant A) is not preferred. So, instead of predicting scores for each document, it cares much about relevant ordering among all the documents.\nGenerating clean data from historical sessions is very important. Since every model follows \u2018Garbage In, Garbage Out\u2019 principle, we have to be very careful of missing logs, sessions with inconsistent data and, most importantly, anomalies in feature values.\nWe follow the same steps to generate training and validation data; the only difference is the time duration which is different for different cases. We pull all the sessions from the past few weeks. Each session corresponds to an instance in our data. Let\u2019s say when a customer searches for a dish, we show them a set of restaurants providing that particular dish, and when she orders from one of them, an instance is completed. For an instance to be counted, there has to be some material interaction between the customer and the restaurant tab such as clicking at the restaurant, browsing through the menu, or ordering from it.\u00a0\nHere, we mark the label corresponding to the restaurant from which the customer orders as 1 (positive sample). Similarly, the restaurant from which the customer does not order in that session is given label 0 (negative sample). Since there can be a lot of negative samples for each positive sample, we take M negative samples above the positive sample and N negative samples below it. We also tried other sampling approaches like random sampling for negative labels, but the top-M and bottom-N approach worked better for us.\nWe experimented with all the variants \u2013 Pointwise, Pairwise, and Listwise \u2013 to determine the most suitable algorithm for our purpose. Here\u2019s what we observed \u2013\nPairwise approach was providing better results than the Pointwise and Listwise approaches\nAccuracy@5 for Pairwise approach was 14% better than Pointwise and 8% better than Listwise approach\nAll restaurant names in the above figure are fictitious and are solely used for representation purposes.\u00a0\nHere, r_aov refers to restaurant average order value and customer aov refers to customer average order value.\nIn the above figure, different customers have searched for the same dish \u2013 pizza. We can see the top five restaurants given by the model, wherein the model has recommended restaurants based on the spending capacity of customers. Similarly, the model also caters to the customer\u2019s veg and non-veg restaurant preference and gives higher weightage to restaurants previously ordered by the customer.\nWe tested our model and the current logic (baseline) on MRR and Order Accuracy@5, and observed a significant increase in both the metrics on the home page as well as on dish search pages.\nModel Deployment\nAll our machine learning models run behind an in-house ML API Gateway Service (Butterfly). We have deployed the ranking model on Kubernetes behind Butterfly. We also use \nMLflow\n1\n (an open source project) as a central model registry to manage our models. To deploy any of our models, we log our models on Zomato MLflow Server. The model has been developed in Python using \nLambdaMART\n2\n implementation from the \nXGBoost\n3\n library and converted into MLflow format for deployment.\nAs depicted in the figure below, the candidate-promoted restaurants are available with ads-service which calls the ML API gateway for reranking. The API (Application Programming Interface) gateway service fetches features from our Feature Store/ Profile Store and passes them onto the model server. The model server then does the re-ranking and returns the relevance scores to ads-service via the gateway. Further ads-service does some post-processing on the scores and renders the result page as per the new ranking. The features are populated into feature-store using daily and weekly python-jobs running on airflow.\nExperimentation and Results\u00a0\nTo understand the impact of the new model on customers and our business, we divide the population into Control Group/ Treatment Group (CG/ TG) for A/B testing. We did an A/B testing across Pan India with a 50/50 split of the population between the proposed model and the current algorithm. Here\u2019s what we observed \u2013 \u00a0\nAn increase in customers ordering from the listing pages instead of the search bar. This implies that more customers found our recommendations relevant to their needs and hence decided to order from these restaurants quickly rather than spending time searching and scrolling through.\u00a0\nConclusion and Next steps\nOur recommendation model has shown promising results and made ordering choices for our customers easier; while making sure adequate visibility for promoted restaurants. Improvements in Click Through Rate (CTR) and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) both signify that recommendation relevance for customers has increased. In simple terms, say, customers that found a relevant restaurant in the first eight recommendations earlier, now find it in the first six or even less.\nCan our recommendations get better? The answer to this question is always a yes.\u00a0\nWe have been monitoring the predictions and have observed the following key areas of improvement:\u00a0\nPersonalisation sensitivity across different pages (delivery vs homepage) varies. Therefore, it seems wise to approach relevance at a more granular level, i.e., look at relevance specifically for the dish \u2018Dal Makhani\u2019 instead of looking at all dish searches through one lens.\nDifferent customer cohorts respond differently to personalised suggestions. Relevance for some cohorts can be made better by indexing more on discovery and exploration rather than personal preferences.\nIn this article, our Machine Learning team shares how they run restaurant ads on Zomato.

        "content": "Dear Readers,\nAs India achieves the important milestone of completing 75 years of independence this month, we stand tall as Indians and are grateful for where we are as a country today and the tremendous potential that lies ahead. As a nation, we have made great progress across multiple facets during these 75 years \u2013 be it the growth and resilience of our economy vis-\u00e0-vis the continuing global turmoil, advances in infrastructure \u2013 physical and digital, financial and tax reforms, defence capabilities, and socio-economic development goals.\nAn important enabler of the transformation of our nation has been technology. India has been at the forefront of laying digital infrastructure railroads much ahead of time, enabling us to leapfrog development at a pace much faster than several developed nations globally. One such example is the successful implementation of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in the country, which has democratized access to digital payments and accelerated financial inclusion and transparency. We applaud the government for its stellar execution on this.\nAs a home-grown internet company ourselves, we feel proud to have contributed to the growth of the digital ecosystem in India. As we complete our first year as an internet company listed on Indian stock exchanges, we reflect on the achievements and learnings during the year and look to the future with more conviction in the India growth story, which motivates us more than ever to do our best and make our nation proud.\nWe hope you enjoy reading our Q1FY23 shareholders\u2019 letter (\nClick here to view PDF\n). In this letter, we continue with the \u2018easy-to-read\u2019 Q&A format we introduced a couple of quarters ago.

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/unique-addresses/",
        "author": "Data Science Team",
        "content": "At Zomato, identifying the correct drop location is an important metric, as it governs and impacts a variety of things like\u00a0an order\u2019s estimated time of arrival, location serviceability and more.\u00a0\nWhile it\u2019s comparatively easy to locate the drop location, it\u2019s hard to identify if two different-looking locations are the same or not. One customer might write \nA-4, XYZ Apartments\n while their flatmate might write their address as \nA/4, First Floor, XYZ Apartments\n. A few syntax changes can make it look like a different address altogether such as a permutation of words and/or alphabets in an address string making data difficult to read.\u00a0\nNow imagine if members of the same building write their addresses distinctly. While navigating a pin location is the easy part, confirming if proximal people belong to the same building with identical addresses, is a steep climb.\u00a0\nSuch situations can come up on a daily basis when we have to:\nDifferentiate public addresses (railway stations, hotels, hospitals) from private ones (homes)\nEvaluate the reliability of addresses based on success rates\nOur experiment and output with word embeddings\u00a0\nTo solve such challenges, we deployed machine learning algorithms that helped us to automate clustering addresses, identify gibberish/fraudulent addresses, and improve existing address strings.\u00a0\nWe soon realised that for us, word embeddings alone would not solve the problem,\u00a0 developing an understanding of the sequence of words was\u00a0equally critical. With increasing use cases of string/sentence application in the real world, a lot of pre-trained models are already in the machine learning ecosystem.\u00a0\u00a0\nOne of the effective models we, use is the \nSBERT or Sentence BERT embedding\n2\n on address strings that \nclustered\n them to identify similar address texts.\nBERT [Bi-directional Encoder Representations from Transformers] by Google AI is an encoder transformer\n. \nLanguage models which are bidirectional have a deeper understanding of the context.\nPrior to 2017, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) were used for most of the NLP cases. RNN works on encoder and decoder mechanisms. The encoder encodes input text and converts it into a context vector, then this context vector is passed to a decoder network, which predicts the output. Every token produced by our decoder is sent to the Attention mechanism, which helps us to identify where Attention is needed. The Attention mechanism further allows the decoder to focus on most of the relevant words in the encoder.\u00a0\nPost-2017, a research paper titled \n\u2018Attention Is All You Need\u2019\n1\n gave birth to transformers. Transformers use Attention alone. But here, Attention is modified a bit, with three fundamental changes:\nPositional Encoding:\n With lots of data, the model learns the position of words. Encoding works by adding a set of varying sine wave activations to each input embedding. These activations vary based on the position of the word/token\nIn the below example, we see the city in two different positions\u00a0\nSelf-Attention:\n Attention is applied to the word and the other words in their own context\n. \nPreviously, we have seen Attention applied between decoder to encoder. In contrast, Self-Attention is applied between encoder and encoder, which not only gets the word\u2019s meaning but also embeds the context of the word into its vector or word representations. This enriched embedding helps identify disambiguated words, parts of speech, and even word tenses.\nMulti-head Attention: \nWe applied several parallel Attention mechanisms to work together, which allowed the representations of several sets instead of single sets.\nWe can use this with current NNs but it is far less effective. So with transformed models, we take the core of the model, which is being trained using a significant amount of time and computing power by the likes of Google/openAI. We add a few layers to its end to make it specific for our use case and then train to fine-tune it. One of the most popular models is BERT \u2013 a state-of-art language model. While generating embeddings, BERT masks the word in focus, which helps to avoid having a fixed meaning independent of its context. This method also forces BERT to identify masked words based on their context.\nSince we wanted to capture semantic similarities between addresses, transformers did not work as they focused on word/token embeddings, which was not helpful in our use case. Rather, we were interested in Sentence Transformers as they work better on semantic embeddings.\u00a0\nBefore this, there were cross encoders, so we would have a BERT cross encoder model [core BERT model followed by a feed-forward neural network]. This was helpful but not scalable.\u00a0\nToday, one widely used method for getting sentence embeddings is calculating the mean of all the word/token embeddings from the sentence. But these values from the mean pooling approach are not accurate.\u00a0\nIn 2019, a solution came in the form of a \nSentence transformer/Sentence BERT\n.\u00a0\nDiscovering \nSentence Transformers \u2013 our Eureka moment\nThe transformer fine-tunes sentence pairs using a Siamese architecture/ Siamese network. Siamese architecture is two BERT models that are identical, the weight between these two models is tied. Because of this, SBERT is also known as a twin network as it allows two sentences to process simultaneously. While implementing, we use a single BERT model and process one sentence as sentenceA to the model and process another sentence as sentenceB to the model. During training, weights with inverts are optimised to reduce the difference between two vector embeddings or two-sentence embeddings. Those sentence embeddings are called\n u\n and \nv. \nWe get these embeddings after mean pooling. The pooling layers help get a fixed size representation for input sentences of varying lengths.\u00a0\nFurther, these embeddings are used to cluster and find similar address strings. We use DBSCAN (Density-based spatial clustering of applications) for clustering.\nOne of the exciting challenges we faced during this exercise was identifying private/ public/ fraudulent addresses from the vast pool of all addresses. To solve for this, we deployed \nthe Simpson diversity index\n to calculate diversity on the basis of which we grouped addresses:\nWhat\u2019s next? Solving for the next set of problems\nBuild a custom dictionary to cater to\u00a0all Indian names and manage proper nouns such as Indianised place names\nExplore grouped address risk scores to better identify customer recklessness or intent to do fraud\u00a0\u00a0\nThat\u2019s all folks. Stay tuned for more explorative blogs on how we improve our tech offerings for all of you, one technical tweak at a time.\nThis is a Machine Learning article to share how our Data Science team tackles the problem of unique address identification.

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/a-digital-thrust-to-empower-street-vendors/",
        "author": "Communications Team",
        "content": "Street vendors were amongst the first to face the economic wrath of the COVID-19-induced lockdown. With a severe dip in daily income, street vendors lost business and livelihood sources \u2013 making it difficult for them to meet ends. Pandemic-induced lockdowns further led to stall closures and a draught in customer inflow, aided by the wariness of street food amidst customers, even as they began stepping out.\nTo help the street vendors, we collaborated with the Government of India (GoI) in February 2021 (during the first COVID-19 wave) to help revive the street vendors\u2019 business by providing them online access to a wider customer base. GoI had launched a specialised scheme called the Prime Minister Street Vendor\u2019s AtmaNirbhar Nidhi Scheme or PM SVANidhi Scheme. Funded by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), the initiative was aimed to facilitate working capital loans, incentivise regular repayments and increase digital transactions for street vendors.\u00a0\nZomato saw this collaboration as an opportunity to empower and digitise the vendors and create economic independence for them. We \nsigned\n a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) to onboard street vendors across multiple cities on Zomato\u2019s technology platforms. It was a bid to improve their livelihoods and diminish the impact of the pandemic on their businesses.\u00a0\nA digital leap\nWe onboarded ~965 street vendors in FY22 on the Zomato platform, from across India, including Nagpur, Bhopal, Ludhiana, Jabalpur, and Vadodara.\u00a0\nRoop Singh\n is one such street vendor and the name behind the \u2018Indori Famous Utsav Poha\u2019 stall in Bhopal. He has been running his stall for 12 years and cultivated massive popularity for his poha. Since being onboarded on the Zomato platform, he has earned close to INR 6,000 daily.\nIn another city (Nagpur), for nearly ten years now, \nKalpesh\n has been running his stall \u2013 Ashirwad Snacks Zone, selling various snacks. His name is close to local celebrity, with his sandwiches drawing daily crowds. Kalpesh\u2019s dream to scale further came to a staggering halt during the COVID-induced lockdown of 2020. Zomato reached out to him to help him counter the impact of the pandemic. Leveraging our tech platform and its vast footprint, Kalpesh improved his sales substantially (close to a 40% growth). His sandwiches are now being delivered across the city. And soon, he became one of the top-rated street vendors in the city. Kalpesh is dreaming again, hoping to open a franchise one day to sell his sandwiches country-wide.\nZomato is committed to onboarding street vendors by providing them access to a large customer base, helping them with FSSAI licensing applications and extending learning resources. We also continue to build their capacity on how to utilise the technology platform for their benefit, including suggestions on designing and structuring the menu to place bestsellers at the very top and marking them for increased customer attention.\nWe believe digitising India needs a collective push. As we celebrate Digital India Week 2022, we commend all efforts to uplift and empower street vendors. Zomato is grateful to have played a supporting role in the digital journeys of their businesses.\u00a0\nImages are owned by Zomato."

        "author": "Data Platform Team",
        "content": "Engineers don\u2019t search for things; they raise queries!\u00a0\nMuch like how we use Google for everyday things, techies use an internal repository (aka SQL search engine) to discover data that is important to them. At Zomato, different teams have different requirements. For example, the City Lead team might be interested in knowing the number of orders placed in NCR last week, Customer Support might want to know how many queries were solved in a minute, Product Team would like to know the number of customers participating in Zomato Premier League on the day of KKR vs CSK, Social Media might like to know the most-searched dishes on New Year\u2019s Eve, and more. In a nutshell, you get how broad our query types are. To maintain and facilitate such a variety, we need a reliable SQL (Structured Query Language) search engine that can provide better and more relevant results to one and all.\u00a0\nAt Zomato, our Data Platform team is responsible for building and maintaining a reliable platform with the core aim of making data an essential part of Zomato\u2019s DNA. To achieve this, our platform should be able to minimise the wait time, i.e., the period between raising a query and getting the results. At our scale, it is a challenge to maintain this without proper infrastructure and efficient data storage.\u00a0\nWe currently use Trino as the query engine to power Zomans to build analytical systems to extract actionable insights from our data lake, run a series of experiments, and build ML models. Trino is a huge part of our data stack due to its industry-standard SQL interface and ability to join and aggregate data across heterogeneous data sources like Apache Hive, MySQL, Apache Druid, Apache Pinot, MongoDB, etc.\nZomans consume data using query and visualisation tools such as Apache Superset, Redash, Jupyter notebooks, and our custom python SDK \u2013 PyJumbo.\nTalk numbers to me \u2013 query scale and workloads\nWe observed that the query workloads can be broadly divided into the following categories:\nScheduled ETLs/ reports\n: Long ETL(Extract, Transform, Load) queries, with runtime up to 3 hours. Typically, these are materialised views to speed-up dashboard queries run through an internal platform built on top of Apache Airflow with an in-built full query retry mechanism.\nDashboard queries\n: Short queries, with runtime up to 3 minutes. These are primarily used to build and share dashboards for various business process monitoring.\nAdhoc analysis: \nMedium duration queries, with a maximum runtime of 20 minutes. Used for debugging and other adhoc use cases.\nBased on the usage pattern, we can individually tune the cluster by segregating them for performance and robustness.\nReady? Set? Deploy!\u00a0\nWe are currently running Trino on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) using our custom Trino image, wherein we have integrated the following components:\nZomato Trino query-log plugin:\n A query logging plugin based on the Trino \nEvent listener framework\n1\n. We log all query completed events and use them to create metrics that help us power the \ngolden-signal\n2\n Trino dashboard. We regularly analyse queries to tune our hive tables data layout by tuning data file size and using column-level indexing(Bloom filters). We also compute column-level statistics to enable \nCost-Based Optimizer\n3\nTrino User Defined Functions (UDFs):\n Custom UDFs based on the needs of Zomans, like custom geo functions.\nVerifier and Benchmark:\n Before rolling out a new Trino version, we benchmark the new version to measure the performance of queries. In addition to this, we also use Trino Verifier to compare the query results produced by two different clusters.\u00a0\nThis is incredibly useful to identify any backward-incompatible changes present in the new version. For instance, \nTrino version 341\n4\n had a backward-incompatible change for the timestamp column. This tool helped us identify and isolate the change before rolling out the new version.\nSetting up alerts to solve bottlenecks and debug issues\nSince Trino executes queries from various sources by distributing them across different workers, it becomes difficult to identify bottlenecks and debug service issues. Through Trino JMX and docker container metrics, we can create real-time monitoring dashboards to help debug issues with our clusters. Some of the\u00a0 PagerDuty alerts we have:\nP95 query execution/queued time of cluster\nNumber of active workers\u00a0\nRate of type of query failures (user, internal, external, or insufficient resource)\nNumber of queued and running queries\nApart from real-time monitoring, we have also set alerts on our Trino query logs to\u00a0\nidentify bad queries choking the clusters\u00a0\nregularly look for query resource usage (bytes scan, total stages, total runtime, etc) to fine-tune our cluster configurations\nGoing Biiiiiiig \u2013 Scaling Trino\nAs Zomato grew, the need for data-driven analysis also increased, and so did our cost for the Trino setup.\u00a0\nAfter deploying Trino, we soon understood that only time-based autoscaling would not work because of two reasons:\u00a0\nWe need to scale our cluster according to the traffic\nWe want to gracefully shutdown unnecessary extra nodes during the off-peak times\nA mould that fits all needs \u2013 Custom Autoscaler\nWe aimed to increase the cluster\u2019s effective utilisation, all while offering a reliable customer experience.\u00a0\nWhile looking for the auto-scaling solution, it became clear that Trino cannot be scaled based on CPU/Memory metrics like any other service. \nWe experimented with multiple scaling conditions but finally settled on scaling the cluster on the ratio of running queries and active workers.\n We experimented with queued queries metric in the scaling equation but soon removed it as we realised it was more biased towards upscaling the cluster and was not going well with our resource groups.\nUpscale if runningQueries/activeWorkers > THRESHOLD\nDownscale if runningQueries/activeWorkers < THRESHOLD\nWe calculated the value of \nTHRESHOLD\n based on the maximum number of nodes, maximum concurrent queries, and query max memory per node.\nWith this custom auto-scaler, we managed our workload more efficiently. In addition, we also reduced the cluster cost by 30-40%, with 0 downtimes during downscaling.\nGetting to the next step \u2013 Presto Gateway\nAs the scale increased, we faced frequent cluster slowdowns, even with our custom auto-scaler. We realised that a single cluster will not be enough to scale indefinitely and we need a multi-cluster concept to manage our workloads. Hence, we decided to use a load balancer/ proxy/ gateway for prestoDB/ Trino called \npresto-gateway\n5\n open-sourced by Lyft.\nIn Lyft\u2019s own words \u2013 \n\u2018Presto-Gateway is a stateful load-balancer, proxy and router for multiple presto clusters, it provides transparent access to underlying presto-backend without changing the protocol.\u2019\nSince then, we\u2019ve added functionalities on top of it. This service makes visualisation tools/ SDKs agnostic of specific Trino versions and enables the following usages. Some of these features are in active development and we are slowly moving all our visualisation tools/ SDKs from specific clusters to Presto Gateway.\u00a0\nSupport for converting X-Presto Headers to X-Trino headers to make it backwards compatible for our custom visualisation tools/ SDKs\nOverall Presto cluster\u2019s health visibility\nQuery cost/thinking estimation routing\nWith Trino, Zomans say Bingo!\nTrino has become an integral part of our day-to-day life. Be it \u2013 analytics, reporting, data quality, or lineage tracking. With Trino\u2019s architecture, we can empower Zomans to make data-driven decisions. In the future blogs, we will talk about\nHow we decided the best instances for our different workloads?\nMigration of Trino to Amazon ECS from Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR)\nRunning Trino on AWS Graviton instances\nThis is a data platform article to share how we scaled Trino to smoothly facilitate our growing number of queries.

We have seen this industry grow rapidly both in India and globally, as customers have found great value in quick delivery of groceries and other essentials. This business is also synergistic with our core food business, giving Zomato the right to win in the long-term.\nWe are proposing to acquire Blinkit, a quick commerce business in India and where we first invested in August last year. This foray into the next big category is timely as our existing food business is steadily growing towards profitability \u2013 Zomato has grown at a CAGR of 86% in the last 4 years to an adjusted revenue of INR 55.4 billion ($710 million) while the adjusted EBITDA margin has improved from (153%) in FY19 to (18%) in FY22.\u00a0\nI am sure there are a lot of questions on your mind with regards to this proposed acquisition and the Q&A below between Akshant (CFO), I and Ms Savvy (reminder \u2013 she is a fictitious character) will candidly address all of them. We will also host a conference call at 5 pm India time, June 25, 2022 to address any further questions and clarifications.\nBest,\nDeepinder\nFounder & CEO"

        "content": "Ever wondered what all goes into calculating the ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival) of your food order? From the time it takes a restaurant partner to prepare your food order to the time it takes a delivery partner to reach your location from the restaurant \u2013 the whole picture is much bigger. \u00a0\nHere is an example \u2013\u00a0\nSuppose you order a sundae from an ice cream parlour 5 kilometres away from home. You note that it reaches you within 25 minutes.\u00a0\nOn the other hand, when you order biryani from a restaurant merely 0.5 kilometres away,\u00a0 you note it takes more than 45 mins. Confusing right? Now imagine predicting the optimal FPT for the huge number of dishes that exist on Zomato and the lakhs of restaurants delivering them, each using their own preparation time.\u00a0\nFeels like quite a challenge, right?\nWell, this is one of the significant problems our Data Science team solves \u2013 to predict accurate Food Preparation Time for both customers and restaurant partners while communicating to delivery partners the right time to reach a restaurant.\nStory till now (a quick recap of our previous FPT blog)\nIn our earlier blog \u2013 \nThe Deep Tech Behind Estimating Food Preparation Time\n \u2013 we described what food preparation time means at Zomato and the factors it depends upon. We spoke at length about how the data science model makes predictions.\nFor people who haven\u2019t read the last blog, we highly recommend you give it a read to understand this continued conversation better. Here, we will be sharing the improvements and learnings made on top of the previous model.\nThe winning solution: loss functions for food problems\nRestaurants are operationally-driven systems with multiple dynamics at play. It means that orders with the exact items and quantity can have different food preparation times, depending on the on-ground situation in the kitchens.\u00a0\nThe above curve closely resembles a right-skewed distribution. One can see that the variation of \nchole bhature\n is considerable \u2013 different outlets take different times, and even the same restaurant can take more or less time depending on the rush hours, availability of staff, etc. We aim to build a model which can accurately predict the FPT for such a distribution.\nTraining our model with loss functions like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) has its limitations:\u00a0\nMAE tends to penalise all errors in the same way. Hence, it gives the same weightage to extreme errors and minor errors, which sometimes results in predictions that can be significantly off from actuals (however infrequent),\u00a0\nRMSE tends to penalise extreme errors more but ignores minor errors, providing us with a less accurate model\nFor our use case, we need an accurate model with fewer underestimations ensuring precise and transparent communication with customers.\nHence, we work with alternative loss functions. Here is a brief about the Quantile Loss Function,\u00a0\nFor q < 0.5, our loss function would start penalising the positive error of actual minus predicted more than the negative error making the model predict lower values for Y and vice-versa for q > 0.5. In a special case where q = 0.5, our loss function becomes the same as the MAE loss function, penalising positive and negative errors equally.\nFurther, we can modify this quantile loss function in the following manner, which yields us the benefits of MAE, and at the same time, adds appropriate penalties to the positive and negative errors.\nHere, the variables \nm\n and \nn\n act as a penalty factor for positive and negative errors, respectively. These can be tweaked in such a way that it yields a model optimised to work on corresponding business metrics.\nMulti-tasking like a boss \u2013 designing a single model to predict multiple outputs\nThe previous model could only predict the FPT of one order. Over time, we started integrating FPT with multiple downstream processes in our system, which in turn, increased the importance of FPT predictions multifold.\u00a0\nWhile predicting Food Preparation Time (FPT), we also need to predict other values, such as\nWait time of the delivery partner\n \u2013 time a delivery partner is expected to spend waiting at the restaurant after arrival.\nHand-shake time \n\u2013 time a delivery partner typically takes to pick up an order from a restaurant\u2019s counter after reaching, while accounting for queues and other processes such as signing at the entrance, temperature check, etc.\nPredicting targets like these requires overlapping information which is essentially what the core FPT model is. Hence, such targets can become a part of the FPT model itself. All of this together helps us improve our downstream algorithms so that customers get their food within the expected time range.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s elaborate on how we implemented the above-use-cases into our neural network(s).\nInitially, we had a separate model for each use case, each requiring independent training. At a high level, our deep neural network model looked as below \u2013\nA single TensorFlow model of the given architecture consists of ~6 million parameters which take up to 15 hours of training, not to mention the size of resources required to make a real-time prediction with this architecture.\nTraining multiple models with this architecture \u2013 each having 6 million parameters \u2013 makes it very impractical for us to re-train and maintain these models. We needed to make some optimisations to make it more practical to use.\nSince all these models have the same type of information being fed to them, we introduced a multiple-output layer to the model. With its help, we could make multiple predictions with one model itself.\nThe multiple output layer consists of a compilation of multiple fully connected layers, each layer dedicated to making predictions for a dedicated loss function.\u00a0\nPerformance Metrics\nOne network to depict them all \u2013 creating order-level embeddings\nIn the earlier version, to create an embedding of items present in an order, we used to take the weight of the item vector (created using word2vec on item names) based on their quantities and cost. \nNow,  we have updated the order item encoding by using a bi-directional LSTM-based sub-network which takes the word2vec features along with cost, quantity, and historic FPT statistics to create embedding for an order.\nShown below are the embeddings of all orders of \nrestaurant X\n serving multiple cuisines, i.e., North Indian, Chaat, Chinese, desserts etc.\n (\nRed\n) and \nrestaurant Y\n serving only ice creams and desserts \n(\nBlue\n) plotted on a 2D plane using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\u00a0\nWe can see that in the previous methodology, the major density of orders from either of the restaurants is concentrated at one point. In the new model using the Bi-LSTM architecture, there is a clear separation between the orders from the two restaurants (embedding spread over a larger space, giving clearer information). \nHowever, an observant reader might notice some overlap between the order of X and Y, which is because of the similar nature of items being ordered, such as brownies, sundaes etc.\nSmaller, better, faster and stronger!\u00a0\nWhile working on the FPT model, we added many complexities to the model, be it adding new features, training deeper models, or creating more embeddings. Upon continuously increasing the complexity, we ended up increasing the model size resulting in relatively slower predictions, longer training time, more resource utilisation, etc.\u00a0\nTo solve these challenges, we made the below changes which controlled these issues to a large extent \u2013\nTrain embeddings separately:\n We decoupled various embedding layers that were used to encode categorical variables like restaurant IDs, city names, the hour of the day, day of the week, etc.\u00a0These embeddings constituted ~95% of the parameters in the FPT model. To fix this, we trained bigger embeddings\u00a0for such sub-network separately and replace the same in our original\u00a0FPT model. This reduced the FPT model size to a 10th of its original size, making the model lighter. Bonus: predictions became quicker in the production environment.\nBreaking the problem into smaller chunks:\n It\u2019s always better to break a big-looking problem into smaller chunks and solve those chunks one by one. The same holds true when you are training a deep neural network for real-life scenarios.\u00a0For our use case, we created separate models for major cities to capture the city-level distribution better, with the given set of specific parameters. The idea was to make more accurate and better predictions.\n Focusing on the bigger picture \u2013 aligning our tech with the business metrics\nYou can train your model on any loss function, be it MAE, RMSE, or MSE\u2026 the list goes on and on. All these functions may be necessary to train your model because of their convex nature, each having its own pros and cons. However, all this maths and computation would be of no use if the function cannot train a model with some business use.\nHence, it is essential to devise business metrics which can measure the relevance of different iterations of the FPT model. We shall discuss two of these metrics in particular here; these are \u2013\nX-min accuracy\n \u2013 percentage orders where the prediction to lie with X-min of actual\nX-min breach\n \u2013 percentage orders where actual time overshoots the prediction by X-min\nTo ensure that the customer gets the food within the promised time, we want to maximise accuracy and minimise the breaches. At the same time, we don\u2019t want to overestimate time as it might push the customer not to order food from our platform.\nEnough with the theory; show me numbers\nNow that we are familiar with the same terms, or as we say, now that we are on the same page, let\u2019s talk about numbers. Using the above-mentioned strategies, we saw an improvement of\n 4% in 3-min accuracy\n and a reduction of \n9% in 3-min breaches\n over our baseline model.\nNow that we\u2019ve addressed the elephant in the room, what\u2019s next?\nFPT estimation is so crucial to Zomato that we always strive to improve the predictions. While we continue to experiment with architectural changes which make the model larger and more complex, we also seek to develop a better understanding of restaurant processes on the ground. Some of the opportunity areas where we are actively working are\nModifying architecture such that the model can better understand the specifications. For example, \nChole Bhature \nbeing ordered from a process-driven kitchen vs from a home-cooked style kitchen will have different FPTs.\nCreating a real-time self-correcting system using techniques like reinforcement learning. Since we cannot capture all signals impacting FPTs, hence a reactive system works better.\u00a0\nDeveloping a confidence metric for predictions, so that the model can state when it is less confident about certain predictions.\nThis is a follow-up article on how we use machine learning to calculate Food Preparation Time.

        "content": "I vividly remember my first memory of Zomato \u2013 I was enjoying my mid-term break from the Indian Military Academy (IMA) and was craving some greasy North Indian food in Delhi, to redeem the calories I had burnt at the Academy. Of course, the universal question of \u2018where should I eat\u2019 dawned on me. A visiting friend informed me of a website that could help answer just that, and tada! My love affair with Zomato began.\nA year later, I again found myself on the Zomato website, looking for the best restaurants in Pune this time. I had left IMA by now and somehow stumbled upon the \nAbout Us\n page. In no time, I was deep into reading about the story of the founding team and this unique product that was helping people when they were hungry and angry (aka hangry).\u00a0\nSuddenly I knew what I wanted to do next \u2013 help build Zomato. I spent hours searching for the most suitable role, and couple of days later, I was on a call with the People team (HR) to convince them why I wanted to be part of this mission. Luck played a part (yet again), and I made it to the Zomato headquarters (HQ) for an interview.\nChatting with some of the most amazing people, I knew that this was the place I wanted to be at and where I wanted to start the next chapter of my life. I was so excited to become a Zoman! Little did I know that the best 10 years of my life would start from a quaint little farmhouse in Chattarpur, New Delhi (HQ back then).\n10 years later, here I am. I have worked in 8 different functions, launched Zomato in 10 different countries, and have worked on a variety of problems and products that truly, in every sense of the word, change people\u2019s lives for the better. But if there\u2019s one piece that stands out for me \u2013 it is the phenomenal and incredibly driven people I\u2019ve had the fortune to work with over the decade.\u00a0\nAnd that\u2019s why I always say, Zomato is not just a product or an app or a workplace, \nit is a sum total of its people\n.\u00a0\nLooking back, I can say a lot has changed over these 10 years \u2013 offices, people, our apps, and business models. But what has stayed evergreen has been its Culture \u2013 full of hustle, humility, and resilience. We have built this culture on trust and belief in one another. Someone famous once said \u2013 A lot of companies and businesses talk of building a relationship with their clients and customers, the ones that succeed are those who build one with their people first.\nI\u2019ve seen it all here, the highest of highs and the lowest of lows, but with the support of the people, Zomato and I have always come back stronger, sharper and more driven. And I have loved every bit of my time here.\u00a0\n\u200b\u200bI\u2019ll leave you all with a beautiful quote in French, that\u2019s been the source of my drive over the last many years: \n\u201cVous n\u2019\u00eates pas encore arriv\u00e9s, mais vous \u00eates plus proche qu\u2019hier.\u201d\n In English, it roughly translates to: \n\u201cyou haven\u2019t arrived yet, but you are closer than yesterday.\u201d\u00a0\n___\nThis article is written by \nPrakhar Mishra\n and is part of a series called \u2018A Slice of Zoman Life\u2019 wherein Zomans share their journeys, learnings, and experiences at Zomato. Stay tuned to know more about the life and culture at Z.\nAll images were consented to and sourced from Prakhar Mishra\u2019s personal image library."

        "content": "Before we deep dive into more features that make Zomato Search your favourite friend \u2013 the one who always listens and is there for you for all your (food) queries, a quick recap of what we discussed earlier \u2013\nRestaurant search and discovery forms the core of Zomato\u2019s\u00a0platform and our hyperlocal delivery is built on a customer\u2019s convenience to navigate Search easily\nKey features like Auto-suggest tabs, Learn to Rank, and Autocorrect help address search queries faster and more conveniently. Remember \nBarger\n autocorrecting to Burger?\nSearch is a great responsibility that we have built with care and attention to detail. Well we do power millions of search queries daily and as we said earlier, with great numbers, comes great responsibility.\u00a0\nSo let\u2019s dig into more features that make our\n rather your Search\n, better and customer-friendly.\n(Features continued from Part One. \nRead here\n)\nMike testing \u2013 1\u20262\u20263\u2026 Did you know about the Voice Search feature at Zomato?\nWhat is it?\nWe introduced voice search to enable customers to explore restaurants, dishes, or cuisines through voice inputs. A customer can now tap the mic icon to activate the listening mode. The voice search processes the voice input into a text and displays the relevant results on the Search screen.\nWhy did we build it?\nTo enable voice search for customers\u00a0\nTo ease the onboarding process as many people find voice search easier and faster in comparison to typing\u00a0\nTo cater to the current trend in India, wherein people are shifting to voice over text for search\n1\n \nTo make Zomato app more inclusive. Did you know that Indians use voice search twice as much as the rest of the world\n2\nHow did we build it?\nTo enable voice search, we deployed a variety of technical capabilities such as voice transcription (powered by Google on Android and speech framework on iOS devices) and the Natural Language Understanding, built in-house by the Engineering and Data Sciences teams.\u00a0\nHow it works\nOnce a customer gives a command, the automatic speech recognition recognises the voice and converts it into text\nOur Natural Language Understanding then tries to identify the intent and entity from the keywords given in the command\nThese keywords are picked up by our Search engine, which fetches results for the customers in a fraction of a second\nFinally, our voice search merges these technologies with our existing text-based search capability and voila \u2013 your voice-enabled search query is ready to be served and serviced\u00a0\nWhy write tea and evening snacks when you can say \nChai\n and \nSamosa\n? Introducing Natural Language Search\nWhat is it?\nNatural Language Search allows customers to speak or type using their everyday language, rather than common keywords. Now customers can use slangs, phrases or partial sentences in their native language, just like in a casual conversation. While all along, the system in the backend transforms these sentences into searchable queries.\nA few examples of Natural Language Search:\n\u2018Pizza outlets near me\u2019\n\u2018XYZ* \nka\n burger\u2019\n\u2018\nChai \nand\n samosa\n\u2018\nHow did we build it?\nWe have built a model that can predict if a given sentence is a combination of a dish-dish (\nchai\n and \nsamosa\n) or a dish-restaurant (\nchai\n from XYZ place). And once we identify these entities, we provide relevant results like the normal search. \nThis is one of the first yet pivotal steps in the direction of Natural Language search wherein we solve for some common use cases, such as:\nRestaurant + Dish queries\n \u2013 \nJalebi \nfrom XYZ\nDish + Dish queries\n; \nRoti sabzi, Chai samosa\nRestaurant + Near me\n \u2013 XYZ near me\nDish + Near me\n \u2013 Pizza outlets near me\nPlease note: XYZ is a blanket term used instead of specific restaurant names.\u00a0\nDo note: There will still be cases where we will not be able to gauge the intent of certain natural language searches.\nDid you say \npayasa\n or \nkheer\n? Global counterparts and their regional dish aliases \nWhat is it?\nWe added and merged regional names of dishes along with their global names. So customers can use either of the names and will get the relevant search results. For instance, search for \nUpit\n or \nUpma\n and all results for \nUpma\n will show up\n \nor search for \nPayasa\n and \nKhee\nr and you will see all results for \nKheer\n. \nWhy did we build it?\nThe old search experience was quite broken for regional dishes due to which customers could not find what they were looking for.\u00a0\nAdditionally, the restaurants with huge assortments of local dishes were unable to highlight their menu well, which created a cascading effect on outlets serving these dishes.\nFor example, if a certain outlet has mentioned its dish name as \nUpit \non the menu\n \n(regional dish name for the global counterpart \nUpma\n), the outlet will not be searchable for \nUpma\n. Similarly, while searching for \nUpit\n, outlets serving \nUpma\n would not show up in the old search ecosystem.\nHow did we build it?\nWe started with creating a repository of dishes with their regional names and then linking them to their global counterparts, in a bid to increase the search-ability of such types of dishes.\u00a0\nWe also merged these dishes, so that restaurants serving either of these dishes show up when a customer searches for the dish with either of the names (\nUpma\n or \nUpit\n)\nIn the screenshot attached, the regional alias is being shown with the global counterpart name in brackets.\nLet\u2019s search for impact, shall we? Learning and key takeaways!\nThrough our features, we made it easier for our customers to locate the dishes, cuisines, or restaurants. Our improvements also helped in reaching new customers, and overall made search easier and faster for everyone.\nThat\u2019s all folks! On to the next problem solving. \nThis is a two-part series on how and why we introduced new \u2018Search\u2019 features on our app. If you are interested in solving similar problems with a customer-first eye and building features that impact millions, then connect with Himanshu Shukla on \nLinkedIn\n.

Our hyperlocal delivery is built on a customer\u2019s convenience to navigate Search easily. We understand how important this function is and how it affects the customer experience in many ways.\u00a0\nAs a product team, our mission is to make that experience perfect. With every feature we launch, we aim to make our search results more relevant and accurate while ensuring it takes less time to discover a dish, restaurant, or cuisine.\u00a0\nSearch is a system with infinite inputs \u2013 we power millions of search queries daily. With great numbers, comes great responsibility. This blog talks about some of the major features we launched recently to shoulder this responsibility.\nWhat are you looking for \u2013 Delivery or Dining options? Introducing auto-suggest tabs\nWhat is it?\n\u00a0\nWe introduced one-switch tabs on the auto-suggest search for easy and relevant discovery of restaurants, dishes, cuisines etc. for customer-specific requests \u2013 delivery or dining.\u00a0\nWhy did we build it?\nWe wanted to capture a customer\u2019s search intent (which varies for Dining and Delivery) early in their search journey and remove unnecessary noise. For example, a customer\u2019s favourite \nBiryani\n outlet might differ with a change in intent from Delivery to Dining.\nHow did we build it?\nWe finetuned the auto-suggest to provide more contextual and relevant suggestions. For example, we eliminated dining and far away from restaurants (out-of-delivery radius outlets) in case of a delivery search.\nWe further filtered restaurants based on delivery and dine-out flags, making the customer experience better and quicker (read more satisfactory).\u00a0\nBuilding \u2018Learn to Rank\u2019 through ML. And boy! How and how much we learnt!\u00a0\nWhat is it?\n \n\u00a0\nLTR aka \u2018Learn To Rank\u2019 is an ML model used to rank search results based on their past popularity (clicks, taps, conversion etc.) at a regional level.\nWhy did we build it?\nWhile a specific rule was working fine for a region/ district sub-zone or particular scenario, the former ranking model wasn\u2019t working well for all cases/ locations. We had to make it universal.\nOur focus was to improve the relevance of search results and in the process make net conversion better.\u00a0\nHow did we build it?\nThe LTR model contains features based on the popularity of restaurant dishes in a particular region like Delhi-NCR or Pune, which incorporates factors such as historical ordering patterns, popularity information (both city and location level), keyword match, preferences etc.\u00a0\nWe formulated the problem statement as a pairwise classification and set the relevance of data points based on the customer\u2019s dropout factor.\nOur model was based on the methodology elaborated by the \ngradient boosting based model\n1\n.\u00a0\nBarger\n becomes burger, hangry becomes hungry \u2013 enabling autocorrect\nWhat is it?\nIn case a customer misspells a query, this feature provides suggestions similar to the keyword. For example: showing \u2018burger\u2019 when someone types \n\u2018barger\u2019\n.\nWhy did we build it?\nWe wanted to solve for relevance in the case of a misspelt query.\nWe aimed to tackle the problem wherein only those cases were solved which had no return value in the search.\nHow did we build it?\nPeople generally make two kinds of spelling errors: phonetics-based and keyboard-based, so we knew what we had to solve for \u2013\nTo solve phonetics, we designed a custom edit distance based on common phonetic mistakes\nPaniir\n \u2192 Paneer\nChikan\n \u2192 Chicken\nFor keyboard typing errors, we sampled data based on the common mistakes such as typos with adjacent characters\nPixxa\n \u2192 Pizza\nOaneef\n \u2192 Paneer\nWe use features based on dish names and edited distance based on special weightage given to phonetically similar characters (for example, \u2018ee\u2019 and \u2018i\u2019). For this, we decided to follow the \nSiamese network\n2\n model to measure similarity between any two dishes.\nWhen we become fairly certain that the customer\u2019s original search query wouldn\u2019t lead to the intended results, we provide an autocorrect version to show better search results, while also allowing the customer to check results for the original query using\n \nthe\n \u201cSearch instead for\u201d \nheader.\nOn the other hand, when we are not entirely sure if a customer has made a mistake in the original search query, then we show results for the original query while also providing a \u2018did you mean\u2019 header to better understand their ask.\nLet\u2019s search for impact, shall we? Learning and key takeaways!\nThrough our features, we have made it easier for our customers to locate dishes, cuisines, or restaurants.

        "content": "My sinusoidal relationship with food!\nAbout a year ago, I was working with a consultancy firm and was winding up another all-nighter. Groggy-eyed and amped on caffeine, my team was compiling the decks and excel models that had to be presented at 8 AM. I finally shut my eyes at 5 AM after closing all the slides and excels with my team.\u00a0\nHard work paid off and the presentation went well \u2013 the stakeholders were pleased. Still, it wasn\u2019t the impact I wanted. I had a nagging feeling that I was needed elsewhere.\nI spent the entire next week wondering whether management consulting was my calling and if there was another industry where I wanted to create an impact!\u00a0\nWho had thought it would be FOOD!\nI have always had a sinusoidal personal relationship with food \u2013 from being an obese teenager to transforming into what one would consider a fitness enthusiast. I had \u2018evolved\u2019 from having an emotional relationship with food to a purely functional one (of course, the occasional stress-induced binge remains but some skeletons are best left in the closet). This relationship took its toll \u2013 I had to continuously experiment with different meal plans and monitor my body\u2019s response to them. It took me 5 years to figure out what \u2018worked\u2019 for me!\u00a0\nIn my mind, however, it didn\u2019t mean everyone had to go through the same painstaking journey. I wanted to simplify this process for others.\u00a0\nCut to the present, now as a member of the Global Growth team at Zomato, I am a step closer to doing that.\nMy entryway into the food industry\nIt has been a year of being a Zoman and the journey has been nothing short of an enthralling roller coaster ride. Within a span of a few months, I have been a part of three different teams at Zomato and have worked on 10 independent workstreams.\u00a0\nThe Global Growth role at Zomato \u2013 as impressive (-ly ambiguous) as it sounds \u2013 is very similar to the game of Catan. You spend an incredible amount of time devising a strategy to win (read: intense problem solving), followed by a rigorous phase of implementing it (read: execution! execution! execution!). The only difference is that in Catan you have to build roads and townships and collect cards with the combined objective of accumulating points. Whereas, in Global Growth, the objective is fluid \u2013 you may be working with the Supply team on optimising packaging one day and the very next day, on a product-market fit for your health-focused customers.\u00a0\nYou turn up every day not knowing what problem you might end up solving.\nMy first stint at Z was with Supply \u2013 the team responsible for building the backbone of this industry \u2013 our massive restaurant partner network. At that time, we were working to improve key restaurant-driven levers that shape our customer experience. From working with partners to drive greater accuracy in predicting their food preparation time, to launching pan-India training drives on food packaging \u2013 my biggest learning from Supply was stakeholder management. It takes a lot of convincing for partners to invest in the right practices in the short term to reap longer-term benefits.\nCustomer-first. Always.\nBefore I could start seeing hints of complacency within Supply, I was roped into Customer Delight \u2013 the team of unsung heroes responsible for extinguishing all kinds of fires.\u00a0\nWhat started as a two-week brainstorming activity to redefine the way we understood customer concerns, soon stretched to a high-intensity 4-month stint where we shared our new mindset with over 4,000 vendor-side agents and built an in-house \u201csuper team\u201d of 30 associates, committed to not just \u2018support\u2019 but \ndelight\n customers. The most valuable lesson learnt here was to \nalways be customer-first\n.\u00a0\nSomething I found myself revisiting in every subsequent workstream.\nAnd next came the dream team \u2013 the Healthy team!\u00a0\nI found my calling and place in the Healthy team \u2013 my next foray after Customer Delight. The Healthy team is determined to build a product that has seen multiple solutions in the past but not one that stuck and tasted success. The product we are building will hopefully drive a paradigm shift in how we treat food \u2013 from an emotional dependency to a more functional one.\nAlthough each leg of the Global Growth journey has had its own set of learnings, one that was common to all was that \nyou can create an impact in everything you do at Z, all you need is the right combination of grit, promise, and compassion.\u00a0\nWho knows what the next few months or years have in store for me!\u00a0\nThis article is written by \nAaqib Ahmad\n as a part of our series called \u2018A Slice of Zoman Life\u2019 wherein Zomans share their journeys, learnings, and experiences at Zomato. Stay tuned to know more about the life and culture at Z."

        "author": "Piyush Maheswari",
        "content": "Welcome to part two of this series. First, let\u2019s recap what we learnt in \nPart One\n:\nWhy HTTPS is far more secure than HTTP?\nHow can we build a secure connection through SSL?\nWhy are certificates valuable for data protection?\nHow to protect against a MITM attack?\u00a0\nNow that we have learned about SSL Pinning and how one can acquire a certificate,\u00a0let us dig deep into what a certificate is and what forms its composition.\nRead the fine print: what is a Digital Certificate\nA certificate is a file that encapsulates information about the server that owns the certificate. The structure of the certificate uses X.509 standards. X.509 is defined by the International Telecommunication Unions\u2019 Standardization Sector.\nA Digital Certificate consists of a variety of information, such as \u2013\nSubject: Provides the name of the entity (computer, user, network, device, etc.) that is issued the certificate by certificate authorities (CA).\nSerial Number: Provides a unique identifier for each certificate that a CA issues.\nIssuer: Provides a unique name for the CA that issued the certificate.\nValid From: Provides the date and time from when the certificate becomes valid\nValid To: Provides the date and time when the certificate is no longer considered valid\nPublic Key: Contains the public key of the key pair that goes with the certificate\nAlgorithm Identifier: Indicates the algorithm used to sign the certificate\nDigital Signature: Verifies the authenticity of the certificate\nVersion: Indicates the version number of the certificate\nTimeStamp: Shows the time when the certificate was created\nFor more information, please visit the thread \nhere\n1\n. \nCommonly used filename extensions for digital certificates (X.509):\nPEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail): A Base-64 encoding, whose file extension is .pem. The certificate information is enclosed between \u201c \u2014 \u2014 -BEGIN CERTIFICATE \u2014 \u2014 -\u201d and \u201c \u2014 \u2014 -END CERTIFICATE \u2014 \u2014 -\u201d\nPKCS (Public-Key Cryptography Standards): Used to exchange public and private objects in a single file. Its extensions are .p7b, .p7c, .p12 etc.\nDER (Distinguished Encoding Rules): A binary encoding, whose file extensions are .cer, .der and .crt.\nNow the pressing question\u2014 which certificate to pin?\nThe choice of certificate impacts the level of security achieved. It decreases as we move down towards the Root Certificate. Hence, the developers need to choose carefully.\nSSL/Leaf Certificate:\n This is the most secure option. If you pin the leaf certificate, then you can be sure that the presented certificate is yours. But as mentioned earlier, this creates a problem anytime you want to rotate your certificate. When the certificate is changed, everyone\u2019s application needs to be updated.\nIntermediate Certificate:\n When you pin the intermediate certificate, you are placing your trust in intermediate CA that it will not issue an unauthorised certificate for your server. The advantage of this approach is that you can rotate your leaf certificate as often as you want, as long as you use the same intermediate CA.\nRoot Certificate: \nIf you pin the root certificate, you are trusting a collection of certificate authorities \u2014 the root CA itself as well as any intermediaries it trusts \u2013 not to issue unauthorised certificates. This is the least secure option and hence the attack surface is larger.\nIt is generally recommended to pin multiple certificates to decrease the chances of bricking your application. Pinning intermediate and leaf-level certificates together is the popular approach.\nNow let\u2019s find the best approach to pin a certificate \nCertificate Pinning\nIn Certificate Pinning, the developer hardcodes the SSL certificate (X.509 certificates) into an application code. When the application communicates with the server, it checks whether the same certificate is present or not. If it is present, the application proceeds with the communication. Otherwise, it will throw an error. The downside to this type of pinning is if the certificates are rotated regularly, then the application needs to be updated regularly too.\nPublic Key Pinning\nHere, the underlying public keys are pinned to check the integrity of the connection. This is more flexible but a little trickier due to the extra steps are taken to extract the public key from a certificate.\nAs with a certificate, the program checks the extracted public key with its embedded copy of the public key. The underlying public keys in certificates can remain static. Hence, it is immune to the certificate rotation problem.\nThat is all folks. Hope you enjoyed reading about certificates and how they can make your Android experiences more secure.\u00a0\nIf you are interested in identifying and solving problems like these and working with the Android team, connect with \nPiyush Maheswari\n on LinkedIn.

        "content": "It has been over a year of providing meals to hunger-stricken families across the country. When Feeding India launched the Daily Feeding Program in January\u201921, its primary focus was to eradicate hunger and in parallel, reduce the financial burden on its beneficiaries.\u00a0\nLast year, we started with delivering around 3,000 meals in January\u201921 and scaled it to close to one lakh meals in less than nine months.\u00a0\nNearly six months in, Feeding India (FI) has doubled its impact. Currently, we are relentlessly serving over two lakh meals daily across 39 cities in India. A milestone credited to not just the FI team but also the 145+ local NGO partners and numerous individuals and corporations passionate for the cause.\nLessons to shape the next FI chapter\u00a0\nHaving now served over 420 lakh meals last year, we find ourselves in a better position to understand the problem of hunger and malnutrition in India. Additionally, our interactions and learnings on ground are helping shape the future initiatives of FI. A few observations worth sharing with you all are listed below:\nNutrition is a critical component of a meal, especially for child-bearing beneficiaries\nUnderstanding the nutritional requirements of a lactating or pregnant mother \u2013 from the moment they conceive a child and till the child breastfeeds \u2013 is imperative to plan a better composition of the meal provided.\nWhile FI caters to beneficiaries of all ages, a sharper focus on women and children (especially up to two years of age) is sacrosanct towards eliminating malnutrition in India\nAnother valuable learning was that unless malnutrition is tackled, low income groups will remain trapped in a cycle of poverty and chronic illnesses.\u00a0\nWe realise that to maximise impact for as many beneficiaries as possible, our purpose has to evolve to solve for \u2013 not only hunger, but also malnutrition and poverty.\u00a0\nThe way forward\u00a0\nThese insights provide a strong case for designing a new and refined action plan to reduce the burden of malnutrition in the country.\nThe way forward for FI now is to create evidence-based programs with measurable outcomes. We plan to achieve this by partnering with social sector organisations that are running targeted interventions to solve malnutrition among children & women in India.\u00a0\nWe plan to:\na) Build a portfolio of high-quality NGO partners who will be supported with financial aid and capacity-building tools to measure/scale up impact\nb) Partner with organisations to integrate the Daily Feeding India Programme in schools across the country, especially in districts stricken with malnutrition.\nA call for action and partnership\u00a0\nFI is actively looking to partner with NGOs/ social impact organisations that are working to solve malnutrition in India. If you know a credible one please direct them to us.\nFI is determined to build a hunger and malnutrition-free nation and tackle the roadblocks with you, along the way.\nYou can write to us at \ncontact@feedingindia.org\n or visit the following link: \nhttps://www.feedingindia.org/requestfoodsupport\n.\nLet\u2019s make India hunger free and get there soon!"

        "content": "By making our app more secure, we help preserve customer trust and device integrity.\u00a0\nThis article talks about several tips on how to secure your Android experience. Before we deep dive into the process, let\u2019s start with revisiting some basics.\nUnderstanding HTTP and HTTPS\nHTTP stands for \nHypertext Transfer Protocol\n. It is the protocol that is used for viewing web pages on the internet. So, when you type in a web address, like \ngoogle.com\n, you\u2019ll notice that HTTP is automatically added at the beginning of a web address. And this indicates that you are now using HTTP to retrieve/ load this web page.\nNow in standard HTTP, all the information is sent in cleartext. So all the information that is exchanged between your computer and that web server includes any text that you type on that website. This information is then transferred to the public internet. And because it\u2019s transferred in clear text, it\u2019s vulnerable to anybody who wants it, such as hackers.\nAnd this is why HTTPS was developed. HTTPS stands for \nHypertext Transfer Protocol Secure\n. This is HTTP with a security feature. Secure HTTP encrypts the data that is retrieved by HTTP by using encryption algorithms to scramble the data being transferred. In layperson terms, it gives an extra shield of protection to your data.\nHTTPS protects the data by using one of two protocols. One of these protocols is SSL. SSL or \nSecure Sockets Layer\n is a protocol used to ensure data security on the internet by use of public-key encryption.\nBuilding a secure connection: the SSL connect\nTwo computers, one of a client and the other of a server go through a process called an SSL/ TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/ Transport Layer Security). Consider this a series of conversations between the two computers, where SSL works back-and-forth to establish a secure connection.\nDuring the above process, the server responds with the selected cipher suite and sends one or more digital certificates back to the client. The client verifies if those digital certificates are valid and if the server is authentic and not someone who wants to snoop on sensitive information.\nFor more details, please check out this \nlink\n1\n.\nCertifying information\u00a0\u00a0\nCertificates are files that encapsulate information about a server. These certificates are owned by the server and work similarly to an identification card, such as a passport or a driver\u2019s license.\nA certificate can either be issued by a \nCertificate Authority (CA)\n2\n or it can be self-signed. In the first case, the CA must validate the identity of the certificate holder once before it issues the certificate and once when the holder\u2019s app uses the certificate. In the second case, the same entity that issues the certificate can sign it and validate it for use.\nNow, when you get a certificate from a CA, it becomes part of a \nchain of trust\n3\n or a chain of certificates. The number of certificates in the chain depends on the CA\u2019s hierarchical structure.\u00a0\nThe two-tier hierarchy is the most common form. An issuing CA signs the user\u2019s certificate and a root CA signs the issuing CA\u2019s certificate. The root CA is self-signed and the app must trust it at the end.\nWhere does SSL Pinning come into play?\nWhen an app tries to establish a connection to a server, it doesn\u2019t determine which certificates to trust and which not to. The app relies entirely on the certificates that the iOS Trust Store or Android CA\u2019s (by Google) provides.\u00a0\nHowever, this method has a weakness: an attacker can generate a self-signed certificate and include it in the \niOS\n/\nAndroid\n4\n Trust Store or hack a root CA certificate. This allows an attacker to set up a MITM (\nman-in-the-middle\n) attack and capture the transmitted data moving through your app.\nWhat is a MITM attack?\nThe TLS standard is based on X509 Certificates and asymmetric encryption. Simply replacing the protocol name will enable encryption, but the app will trust every certificate issued by the server. This means that the attacker can generate their own fake certificates. The certificates will then allow the hacker to intercept encrypted communication. This kind of attack is called a man-in-the-middle attack.\nHere\u2019s where SSL Pinning comes into the picture. We should use the SSL pinning technique as an additional security layer for application traffic and validate the remote host\u2019s identity. If we do not implement SSL Pinning, the application trusts a custom certificate and allows proxy tools to intercept the traffic.\nSSL Certificate Pinning, or Pinning for short, is the process of associating a host with its certificate or public key. Once you know a host\u2019s certificate or public key, you pin it to that host. In other words, you configure the app to reject all but one or a few predefined certificates or public keys.\nInstead of pinning a public key from a certificate, the complete certificate can be used to verify the identity of the host. The advantage is that the certificate is easiest to pin. You can fetch the certificate either through the band of the website or use the OpenSSL client.\nThere is a downside to pinning a certificate. If the site rotates its certificate regularly, then your application would need to be updated regularly. For example, Google rotates its certificates, so you will need to update your application once a month (if it depends on Google services). Even though Google rotates its certificates, the underlying public keys (within the certificate) remain static.\nThat\u2019s all folks! For now. We will continue learning more about certificates in Part Two.\u00a0\nIf you are interested in solving problems like these, connect with \nPiyush Maheswari\n on LinkedIn.

Our aim was to provide steady food assistance to people, to let them divert their income to other important areas like education planning, health, infrastructure and more.\nThe program focused on states ranking lower on the hunger index. As a result, we extended the program from the capital region to towns and cities in Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan as well\n1\n.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn Rajasthan, we came across thousands of artisans living in rural areas who once helped drive the economy but were now struggling for sustenance through their art. To ensure we reached them faster, we tied up with local foundations and non-governmental organisations driving skill development programs, so that we could enable access to a nutritious diet.\u00a0\nWe partnered with on-ground organisations like \nJaipur Rugs Foundation\n. With their help, we ran our first local Rajasthan campaign starting with Bikaner in November 2021, which was further extended to \nDhanota, Thanagaji, Sarai Bavadi, Khavarani, Kekari, Shahpura, \nand\n Surana\n.\u00a0\nThe responsibility to drive the Daily Feeding Program further became even more crucial for us during the pandemic when many working/ migrated family members returned to their villages. This further strained the earning capacity of the family as suddenly there were many more mouths to feed.\u00a0\nWhat we have seen is that the Daily Feeding Program extends support by not only providing nutritious meals to all family members but also enabling savings. Each ration kit allows a family to save approximately up to INR 700 every month (an estimate provided by the Jaipur Rugs Foundation) \u2013 an amount that can be used to fund other expenses like education, uniforms, weddings or health. In doing so, the program also helps families to avoid borrowing from informal means \u2013 an unhealthy practice that traps a lot of villagers into debt.\nTo date, we have distributed more than 14 lakh meals to hundreds of artisans\u2019 families.\u00a0\nFeeding India\u2019s mission is to extend the Daily Feeding Program to as many beneficiaries as possible. For we believe, a nutritiously-fed family is one step closer to our goal of making India hunger-free.\u00a0\nStories like these affirm our belief that food is far more than a meal and a mere functional need. It is more than just the morsel we eat but a building block of a fulfilling life.\nThis article is part of a running series called Feeding India \u2013 The Lens, where we share the impact, learnings and growth of our key campaign \u2018The Daily Feeding Program\u2019. Through this series, we aim to bring more awareness to our mission of serving daily meals to people in need across India.

The perplexing ordeal of shopping for his meals \u2013 stipulated with multiple simple options for everything, makes him feel out of place. Whereas in another reality, he was contemplating choices about completing missions, watching for explosions and protecting his comrades in a war-ridden Afghanistan. The complexity eventually solves itself towards the end, as James realises his heart lies in making big choices that have a deep impact.\nI often reflect on this scene whenever I am asked, why people chose to come back to work at Zomato? In my eyes, the reason is similar to what James thought of \u2013 choosing the thrill of new challenges and brilliant teamwork over monotony.\nI\u2019ve been with Zomato for eight years now, and I can vouch that the life and culture is unparalleled here. Once you have lived this life, it is hard to live any other way.\u00a0\nFor me, it all started in 2014 \u2013 the year I joined as a Key Account Manager. Initially, I was a little sceptical of the combination of a start-up and sales. It was a hard sell, but I had already placed my bets.\u00a0\nCut to 2022, I can wisely say that all you need to convert your fear and ambiguity into accomplishments is a nudge in the right direction, coupled with the faith that people put in you.\u00a0\nBut why would someone put their faith in you? \nBecause there is a belief that Zomans are always eager to learn and explore. Here, people bet on your amiability, malleability and the ability to innovate and think beyond your role \u2013\u00a0 irrespective of your age or experience. The onus is on you to keep that faith fuelled by adding maximum value and purpose to your role and responsibility.\nThis mindset is encouraged from day one. Or, as I have realised, your longevity here depends on how early you adopt this mindset.\u00a0\nThis is how I\u00a0got to work across departments in all these years \u2013 from account management to product launches to market analysis and many more over the last eight years. More than often, doing different things helped me explore multiple facets of my personality and skill set. I learned more about myself with each passing day.\nHave I been bored? No! Not a single day. Have I been restless? Oh, every day!\nWell, of all the ~3,000 days that I have spent here, I have been super excited for 95% of them, for I had something to look forward to in (almost) all of them. The other 5%, I would like to blame on the weather. Zomato keeps nudging you towards greatness and stays at it till you realise your optimal potential. And in doing so, it ensures that the version of you today is much improved than what it was yesterday.\nEveryone at Z (Zomato) is empowered to invest in building a great product and an organisation that will continue to impact people positively in decades to come.\u00a0\nHaving spent considerable time here, I can tell that Zomans invest their time, hard work, and passion because they see this compounding into monumental scale and growth (professionally and personally). Serving this vision takes precedence over self-interest and enthusiasm. So much so that I have seen people abandoning projects that they worked on wholeheartedly, only to pick newer projects that continue to keep them excitable and innovative.\u00a0\nThe rewards here are driven by learning opportunities. A founder\u2019s mindset is what leads functions here. How would you improve something or identify customer pain points or delivery partners\u2019 grievances? How would you build a better brand?\u00a0\nOn the other hand, failure is not looked down upon. We define failure as an opportunity to learn. To reflect on what went wrong and what could have been better? Most importantly, what did we learn from this foregone opportunity? At the end of the day, what we take to bed and what we make of it is all that matters.\u00a0\nI see my comrades and can proudly say that we, Zomans, do not run away from challenges. We seek them. After all, customer-first thinking requires you to preempt the problems not faced yet, invent solutions that don\u2019t exist, create opportunities that aren\u2019t there, and make Zomato better for our customers, every single day. It is not a game, it is a way of life.\nSuch exhilarating choices we make daily. Now you see why I relate to James?\nWell, that is it from my end. If you took away anything from my outpour here \u2013 may it be a taste for thrill or a desire to acquire it. Well, this is what Zomato is! I am a proud connoisseur of varied tastes by now and am still hungry for more.\u00a0\nFrom being a naive salesperson to becoming someone who embraces speed, execution, and challenges, my years at Zomato have carved an appetite for uncommon problems and a mindset to solve them creatively.\u00a0\nSo, much like James, every time I look at my journey, I realise this is where I belong and if provided with the same choice I was given years ago, I will take that same decision, \nevery single time\n.\nThis article is written by \nPulakit Kaushik\n and is part of a new series called \u2018A Slice of Zoman Life\u2019 wherein Zomans will share the journeys, learnings, and experiences at Zomato. Stay tuned to know more about the life and culture at Z."

        "content": "We ended \nPart ONE\n on our quest to find a robust graph-based embedding solution. Let\u2019s continue our search hereon:\nFinding our match in Cleora\nIn our quest, we stumbled upon an AI framework called \nCleora\n1\n, which claimed to be ~197x faster than DeepWalk or Node2Vec. It checked all the boxes and qualified for our next iteration. Let\u2019s see why:\nCleora\u2019s idea was simple: nodes close to each other should have high similarity scores but not at the cost of driving a not-connected node far away\nCleora was purely unsupervised\nNo explicit learning objective was formulated and no sampling of positive or negative examples was performed\nSo in Cleora, a node embedding is calculated by taking the average weights of its neighbours and then normalising it. While the process is iterative, the number of iterations is a hyperparameter along with the embedding size. However in Cleora\u2019s case, node attributes are not required, thus it is purely based on graph structure and the local neighbourhood.\nWe used Cleora for customer-restaurants graph data in the National Capital Region (NCR) area. And to our delight, the embedding generation was superfast (i.e <5 minutes). For context, do remember that GraphSAGE took ~20hours for the same data in the NCR region.\nSince we had a bipartite graph with customers and restaurants as nodes, the notion of similarity in the embedding space meant that customers interacting with similar restaurants would have had high similarity and vice-versa.\nLet\u2019s find the results\nFollowing are the examples of restaurant-restaurant similarity (out of the top 10 similar restaurants of Gurugram) being captured.\u00a0\nHere, the theme is around restaurants offering healthy food, for which Caterspoint is a vetted example basis customer behaviour.\nHere we notice that customers ordering from a healthy restaurant are likely to be closely connected to other healthy restaurants. No cuisine-related, price-related or any other metadata is passed in the embedding creation process; only customer nodes and restaurant nodes with edges are considered.\u00a0\nHere, the theme is around restaurants offering gourmet food. In this case, customers ordering from high-end restaurants are closely connected to other high-end restaurants.\nHere the theme is restaurants offering regional cuisine. Again, customers ordering from these restaurants will be more closely connected to other similarly placed regional restaurants.\nHence, there is strong evidence to use these embeddings downstream as both customer similarity and restaurant similarity capture the graph related properties robustly.\nWhat we saw with Cleora was that it preserved entity type info, which was important for heterogeneous graphs. However, since both customer and restaurant embeddings are separated (as per the figure above), restaurant recommendations cannot be made by directly taking the dot product between both entities and sorting them based on similarity. To do that, we need to \nrepresent customers in terms of ordered restaurants\n.\u00a0\nOne way would be to use different iteration parameters to calculate customer and restaurant embedding. This way connected restaurants will have high similarity scores, but overall it will be an \u2018overfit\u2019 solution and will not generalise well.\u00a0\nWe can also average out the ordered restaurant\u2019s embeddings. Pretty simple right, but it loses crucial information on the restaurant embedding space. Essentially, this might recommend all the restaurants near the centroid of the ordered from restaurants.\nMore details can be found on \nthis\n2\n thread.\nLimitations\nWhen we wanted to use edge weight into embedding and raised this \nquestion\n3\n in cleora github repo, we found that this feature was not implemented yet.\nAdditionally, unlike graphSAGE, node features could not be used in Cleora.\nNext stop: EMDE (Efficient Manifold Density Estimator)\nTo solve this problem, we decided to explore \nEMDE\n4\n (Efficient Manifold Density Estimator)\n \n\u00a0exploits locality-sensitive hashing to create \u2018\nsketches\u2019\n, i.e. histogram-like structures which represent density on multidimensional manifolds. One can assume that these items are in a continuous shape and not as discrete points in the embedding space. Here, customer preference is the probability density function, so items liked by the customers can act as samples drawn using probability density. EMDE estimates this probability density function.\nEMDE recommender architecture \n(Source: \nAn efficient manifold density estimator for all recommendation systems\n)\nEssentially, this process \ncompresses multiple vectors into a single one\n. It takes item embeddings (from multiple sources) and a list of items per customer as input and returns sparse customer embedding as output. Once customer embedding is calculated, the recommendation task is then straightforward. There are three parts in the algorithm.\nPart 1 : Vector Encoding and Aggregation\nThis includes generating the item and customer sketch. There are two hyperparameters:\nN \u2013 number of independent space partitions\nK \u2013 total number of hyperplanes in single space partitioning\u00a0\nItem sketch\n:\u00a0 the item embedding space is divided into K partitions and use LSH to create an encoding vector. This process is repeated N times and each of the generated vectors are concatenated to get an item sketch. \nLSH\n5\n helps to ensure that semantically, only similar items share their assigned buckets in the sketch, thus preserving the geometric prior from upstream embedding.\nProperties of item sketch\n \u2013\u00a0\nSketch are additive and of constant size (N*K).\nsketch(t\n1\n, .. , t\nn\n)\u00a0 = sketch(t\n1\n) + \u2026. + sketch(t\nn\n)\u00a0\nDimension\n(sketch(t\n1\n, .. , t\nn\n) = \nDimension\n(sketch(t\n1\n)) = \nDimension\n(sketch(t\nn\n))\nSimilar items would have similar sketches: \nsketch\n(roti) \n~\n \nsketch\n(chapati)\nEasily Incorporate time decay. For e.g., customer\u2019s recently ordered food items vs items ordered a few months back, both items have different relevance in customer\u2019s recommendation feed.\nsketch(item) = w(t\n2\n \u2013 t1)sketch(item), where t\n2\n-t\n1\n is time difference, and w are decay force\nCustomer sketch\n: Here, a sketch of each item (from customer interaction) is created independently and all sketches are added along the axis.\nProperties of customer sketch\n \u2013\u00a0\nAssume that customer have interacted with food item (i_1, i_2, \u2026., i_n) previously,\nsketch(customer) = sketch(i_\n1\n, \u2026, i_\nn\n), where |x| is k = 1n|x\nk\n|\n2\nDimension\n(customersketch) = \nDimension\n(item sketch)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPart 2 \u2013 Feed Forward NN\nSince we needed an ML framework to transform a mapping from customer space to item space, we used the Feedforward Neural Network Model, which is used as a conditional density estimator. In this case,\u00a0\ncustomer embedding (customer sketch and customer features) serves as our input\nthe target serves as theitem sketch (customer\u2019s next ordered item)\u00a0\nHere, the input is a collection of previously ordered items and simultaneously, the task predicts which item(s) will be clicked on or ordered next.\n \nThis is valid for any customer-item interaction data where we have embedding for items.\nPart 3 \u2013 Prediction/Item Ranking\n\u00a0\nIn this case, we can compute customer embedding from the model, where the input is customer-sketch and the output is customer embedding.\nWe get the dot product score with item set sketches and sort the items by score in decreasing order to get the ranking.\nExperiment Setup\nWe used K = 128 and N = 20, and computed item embeddings from m = 3 different sources.\u00a0 Therefore, customer \nDimension\n(customersketch) = \nDimension\n(item sketch)\u00a0 \u00a0= K*N*m = 7680\nInput embedding dimension = \nDimension\n(customersketch) + \nDimension\n(customerfeatures)\n= 7680 + 4 = 7684 and Output embedding dimension = 7680\nMajor benefits of EMDE\nEMDE offers flexibility to combine multiple embeddings captured from different modalities. For example, we can get item embedding based on interactions (click/order/add to fav), item names or item images, etc.\nAdvantages of EMDE include:\u00a0\nThe ability to append contextual attributes such as customer price range, time of the day etc.\nIt does not require heavy computation and resources. Hence, it is easier to scale and train as compared to other sequential-based methods like recurrent neural networks (RNN) and graph neural networks (GNN).\nDo note that the common issue with GNN based methods is neighbourhood explosion which impacts the model performance.\u00a0\nFurther, unlike RNN which takes input sequentially and makes the learning slow, this sequential behaviour can easily be captured by sketches by using the additive property. It can also incorporate time decay.\nWhere do we stand now?\nWe are currently using EMDE for\u00a0\nGenerating candidates to facilitate downstream recommendation systems.\u00a0\nIt generates recommendations using density-based rich customer representation.\u00a0\nIt allows us to trace customer look-alikes (\n\u2018People Like You\n\u2019) to find similar users with similar cuisine/taste preferences as well as price affinity.\nWhere do we go from here?\nRecommendation depends on time of the day and location. These two signals need to be incorporated within the EMDE solution. Currently, we are experimenting with the first part of EMDE architecture to provide these inputs and their representation.\nRecall@Top10 = 35%. Seems low but we need to measure this in conjunction with other metrics such as diversity and fairness of our system. Increasing Recall is easy. However, we want to refrain from simply recommending user\u2019s past ordered restaurants and improve the discovery through our platform.\nMore experimentation is needed to incorporate multiple embedding sources and customer feature space to further improve the recommendations.\nCleora + EMDE gives us a generalised framework for recommendation. So we are exploring ways to use it in other applications such as search ranking, dish recommendations, etc.\nThe aim remains to make recommendations more accurate and efficient.

Either way, nothing happens.\u201d \n\u2013\u00a0Yvon Chouinard, Founder of Patagonia\nThe mission to shrink plastic from our world will take a mammoth commitment from all of us. But just talking about reducing plastic won\u2019t reduce plastic in our world; our actions have to speak louder than words.\u00a0\nLast year, we took our first step towards long-term sustainability by launching \u2018Climate Conscious Delivery\u2019 \u2013 we started funding local environmental projects to offset the carbon footprint of all our deliveries and packaging in India.\u00a0\nWe also made \u2018no cutlery required\u2019\u00a0the default option on our app. This helped ensure 74% of orders go without cutlery preventing tonnes of single-use plastic from reaching landfills. We signed up for the EV100 initiative, and have committed to move to a 100% EV fleet by 2030. At every such step, you welcomed our efforts and played an equally important role to make Zomato more sustainable.\u00a0\nDoing all this, last year, we offset ~500,000 MTs of carbon emissions.\n All towards the mission of creating a greener future for our future generations.\u00a0\nHowever, offsetting the carbon footprint or emissions generated in the process of producing \nnew \nplastic packaging does not solve for \nused\n plastic waste reaching landfills and clogging waterways.\nTo date, plastic continues to be widely used for food packaging (approximately 43g per order) as it\u2019s safe for food, lightweight, affordable and prevents spillage. Sadly, most of this plastic, after usage, ends up in landfills permanently damaging our beautiful planet.\nLet\u2019s try changing that?\n\u00a0\nPlastic is a helpful material as long as it stays in a loop of continuous use and re-use. This means waste plastic needs to be collected, processed and re-made into useful objects just like we do for our newspapers, glass bottles and steel vessels. At the same time, we recognize it\u2019s important to start promoting biodegradable and other non-plastic alternatives so that they become as affordable and available as plastic is today.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe are introducing 100% plastic neutral deliveries from this month onwards (April 2022)\nFrom now on, every meal you order through Zomato will be 100% plastic neutral, which means we will voluntarily recycle \nmore than\n 100% of all plastic utilized in your order\u2019s packaging.\nTo achieve this, we have started working with cutting edge ISO-certified plastic waste management organizations who will partner with municipalities across India, to collect and responsibly process plastic waste.\u00a0\nAnd of course, the buck doesn\u2019t stop at only offsetting/recycling the plastic used for deliveries. This is only the first step towards a cleaner earth. Much more work lies ahead of us where we do what we can in order to reduce/eliminate the use of plastic in food delivery completely\u2026\nTherefore, along with offsetting, we are also amping up our efforts to develop and promote sustainable packaging for all types of cuisines..\nWe are aiming to deliver 100+ million \nadditional\n \neco-friendly food delivery orders \n(orders in sustainable packaging) over the course of the next three years, by supporting our restaurant partners in switching to affordable and sustainable packaging alternatives.\nTo achieve this, we\u2019re going to partner with various stakeholders working on innovative solutions and models for the restaurant industry including government-led initiatives, social enterprises and start-ups.\n___\nThis initiative is going to cost us a significant amount of money and of course, going to affect our P&L negatively. However, I strongly believe that what\u2019s good for the planet is good for business. I also believe that profits happen when you do everything else right. And this is surely a step in the right direction.\u00a0\nSee you on a cleaner earth.\u00a0\n________________"

        "content": "If you like ordering Mediterranean cuisine, there are high chances that you might like to try continental dishes too. Now getting that right for one person is a cakewalk but matching preferences of millions of customers with a multitude of food combinations, every day, is simply not easy. Well, this is where data science comes into play.\u00a0\nClassical recommendation algorithms consider a customer\u2019s past behaviour and create interaction features accordingly. At times this can get limited to only the items (restaurants and dishes for us) that the customers interact with, leading to sparsity for mostly our customers interacting with only select restaurants and/or dishes.\u00a0\nThe challenge thus lies in providing richer data in our recommendations to overcome:\u00a0\na) sparsity\u00a0\nb) and redundancy (we get limited to suggesting the same set of restaurants and dishes to customers basis their interaction)\u00a0\nWe use\n knowledge graphs\n to predict which restaurants, dishes, and cuisines will go well with your taste. Unlike tabular data, individual data points are actually linked with each other. So, a customer can be linked to a \u2018\nnever ordered before\n\u2019 from a restaurant that is also connected to other customers \u2013 allowing us to refine our recommendations consistently.\u00a0\nCapturing this relation seemed important. So we ran a few experiments with graph algorithms and observed their viability for automating recommendations. So you see, there\u2019s a lot that goes behind the scenes to perfect our restaurant recommendations for you. Let\u2019s learn more about this in this article.\nGraph Learning\nLately, there have been great advancements in graph learning. \nMany algorithms\n have been developed to solve \nlink prediction, node classification, and node representation problems\n.\u00a0\nOur focus narrows on node representation learning as it can be used in many downstream applications; recommendation being one of them.\nThe idea behind node embedding is to represent each node in form of a latent vector(z) such that\u00a0\nNow the definition of node similarity can vary and mean either of the following:\nAdjacency-based similarity: directly connected nodes\nMulti-hop similarity: nodes appearing in 1-hop, 2-hop neighbour (i.e. 1 hop = 1 jump. Direct connection = 1 hop, whereas 2nd degree connection = 2 hop)\nRandom walk-based similarity: nodes appearing on a random walk\u00a0\nTalk Data to me\nImage:\n The above graph displays customer-restaurant interaction data where:\nnodes represent customers (U1, U2, U3) and restaurants (R1, R2, R3)\nedges represent if interaction happens between customers and restaurants\nPlease note that graphs can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous. Let\u2019s elaborate:\nhomogeneous graphs: All nodes represent the same entity and edges represent the same relation between nodes\u00a0\nheterogeneous graphs: The nodes and the edges can be of different types\u00a0\nIn our case, the graph is heterogeneous since customers and restaurants are two different entities. However, we used a conversion, i.e. homogeneous one, to apply available graph learning algorithms, since the majority of available research is focused on homogeneous graphs.\nNow let\u2019s get more graph-ic!\nSection 1: Introduction to GraphSAGE\nGraphSAGE\n is a framework for inductive representation learning on large graphs. We preferred GraphSAGE because:\nIt is inductive and fits our requirement to create dynamic graphs.\nIt does not require re-training (in case there\u2019s a new restaurant or customer onboarded)\nIt is flexible and facilitates transfer learning so that a model trained in one city can be replicated in other cities\u00a0\nImage:\n The similarity aspect is calculated via aggregating the k-hop neighbourhood.\u00a0\nFor any \nsupervised learning \ntasks, training data with labels is needed. In the case of homogenous graphs, the node labels can be used to train and do node classification. For heterogeneous graphs, supervised learning can be used for the link prediction where the link could be # of orders between a customer and a restaurant.\nSince our main objective was to learn generic node representations using graphs and so that graph-based similarity remains intact, \nunsupervised learning\n was more appropriate. For that to happen,\nOne can randomly choose a node and do a random walk of fixed length. All nodes appearing on this walk would be labelled as +ve samples.\nPick an equal number of -ve samples from far away nodes randomly\nThe model is trained to classify these +ve and -ve pairs. The main hyperparameters we tested:\nK: used values are 1 or 2\nLength of random walk (in nodes): 3, 4, 5, 6\u00a0\nNo. of random walk per node: 2, 3\nNode embedding shape: 256, 512, 1024\nFrom the node representations thus generated (Iteration 0), we used cosine similarity between customer-restaurant pairs as a feature in our downstream personalisation model. It came out as the second most important feature as per SHAP values and we also observed a slight improvement in AUC.\u00a0\nSection 2: Further experimenting with GraphSAGE\nIn a bid to generate more direct recommendations, we narrowed our focus to improving two measures:\nMean reciprocal rank (MRR), Precision@k and Recall@k\nTraining time\u00a0\nLet\u2019s see how our iterations fared\nWhat did we learn from our experimentations?\nAlthough treated as a homogenous graph, customers and restaurants have to be treated as different entities owing to differences in their respective degrees of connection. The majority of customer nodes connect to a few restaurants, but the restaurant will connect to a higher number of customers. Opting for a heterogeneous graph is thus preferred\nFor unsupervised learning, we took random nodes as negative samples; nodes not present in the random walk. However, a mere absence of direct interaction between nodes does not particularly mean that it\u2019s a negative sample.\u00a0\nImprovements in accuracy weren\u2019t significant enough to offset the cost of high training time. Training time for just NCR data was ~20 hours. Also, models trained in one city were not able to perform well in other cities. Managing multiple city-level models would have been a nightmare.\nGraphSAGE \u2013 not a rage!\nAlas, while GraphSAGE proved to be a useful technique, we realised scaling it up to up to 500 cities with operations was not practical. Our search for a robust graph-based embedding solution was still on.\nThis is a two-part series on improving the recommendation search for our customers. Read \nPart Two here\n, where we fulfill our quest to find a robust, graph-based embedding solution. \nIf you are interested to work with us and work on such innovative problem solving, then connect with \nManav Gupta\n on Linkedin.

The data is structured like a non-negative & non-normal probability distribution, after the data exploration steps. For modelling structured data, gradient boosting trees have been shown to function as well as, if not better than, Neural Nets-based solutions. We examined popular gradient frameworks like XGboost LightGBM and Catboost, and chose to go ahead with LightGBM keeping in mind its quicker training pace, accuracy and flexibility.\u00a0\nNever underestimate the power of statistics \u2013\u00a0\nWe leverage the power of statistics, after employing finely planned data filtration procedures depending on speed, locations, errors, client interactions and several other factors. When the data is split by city, a non-negative right-skewed exponential distribution with a long tail is observed. The curve is best fitted by a Gamma-Poisson distribution. We evaluated a gamma distribution with L1 loss using basic temporal and geospatial features, which offered improved accuracy but increased model size.\nTweedie response can be a Poisson-Gamma response around some configurable Tweedie variance power parameter that may be iterated during training. By capturing the long tail events, the properties of Tweedie distribution with a log-link & \u2018L1\u2019 as the metric resulted in a superior fit of the model with a smaller memory footprint.\nDivide and conquer \u2013\u00a0\nAnother method we employed was to create unique models for each city to better capture the city\u2019s key traits for us. Similarly, the forecast was split into two parts: one from pickup to the drop-zone Geofence, and the other from drop time to handover.\nHyper-parameter tuning \u2013\nThe increased number of models created a requirement for an auto-tuner. After rigorous testing, we depended upon LightGBMTuner in the Optuna hyperparameter optimisation framework. This optimization tunes key parameters, such as L1-L2 regularisation param, bagging frequency param and the number of leaves param, controlling the complexity and depth of the tree to prevent overfitting of the model.\u00a0\nOther tuning steps included tuning of Tweedie variance power, boosting types, learning rate, min boosting round, early_stopping, max_bin which essentially define the distribution characteristics, depth, number of trees, no. of bins for the feature, etc in the model.\nFeature Engineering \u2013\nFor the base model, we were prudent in choosing features and kept them to a minimum to ensure our results were meaningful. To preserve latency performance, the accuracy improvement threshold was kept high. Key features included Geospatial features like shipping & drop-zone coordinates, time-domain features, restaurant features. Transformative features included polar coordinates system with the origin at the restaurant, aerial distance as radius, and angle as the bearing between shipping and drop zone.\u00a0\nTo speed up the serving process, we ran a few experiments, the key ones being the following \u2013\u00a0\nTo improve model performance in real-time serving, we used the Microsoft Hummingbird framework, which converted the model into tensors that could subsequently be served using ONNX, PyTorch, and Apache TVM-based serving. Although these optimisations reduced model size, the native LightGBM booster was able to manage higher throughput per instance with comparable latencies in CPU-based deployments.\nML Serving Design \nData scientists develop ML models for different business use cases and schedule automated training for regular updates of the model. The model gets logged in the S3 artifact store. The prediction cluster loads models from the artifact store and serves the incoming requests.\nUpgrading the ML framework \u2013\u00a0\nFor our ML platform, we switched to a FastAPI-based serving platform from MLflow; serving which cut our framework latency in half. As Python is widely used in our machine learning and data science teams, it supports Python-based syntax, which aided us in our objective of democratising model deployment. It enabled us to serve an ensemble of models. Low latency also aided us in expanding the model\u2019s depths in order to enhance predictions. We also put FastAPI-based serving of TVM, Pytorch, and ONNX-based models to the test which also showed similar improvements. The following graph shows the improvements in performance with FastAPI for the same traffic and model.\nWith MLflow serving:\nWith FastAPI serving:\nWith this experiment, we were able to see a 3x improvement in throughput per pod and a 2x improvement in latency. From our observations, MLflow takes a significantly longer time (7 \u2013 8 milliseconds in our use case) to serve any request as compared to FastAPI (2 \u2013 3 milliseconds in our use case).\nAll this led to\n improvement in mean error, absolute error, R2 score, and standard deviation using a limited number of features and distribution analysis. Without sacrificing much on compliance, the improvement in accuracy was the largest. As previously noted, optimising the model for compliance without compromising accuracy is more beneficial in our business case. We found tuneable scaling factors that transform the results into a significant increase in compliance matrices with only marginal loss in accuracy.\nThe overall cost of serving millions of calls was less than $10 (approx. INR 754.57)\u00a0 per day for the base model with limited features. Both CPU and memory costs were reduced to half as compared to our initial stable deployments.\nImproving Systems and Operations \u2013\u00a0\nThe investigation into the causes of DP-ETA delays also indicates different improvements in processes and systems such as DP application, DP assignment, restaurant dispatch, and location databases.\nWe\u2019ve been creating relevant nudges for other systems utilising process mining concepts. Shap was used to ensure that the model was easy to understand and that attributes had a role in determining the forecast. It also aided in the trimming of features.\u00a0 Another use case for this level of explainability is determining the source of the delay, which may aid us in developing better nudges for our system. It can also assist us in performing an inverse search to anticipate better restaurant locations.\u00a0\nWe trained models with features from several domains, such as the DP domain and the Location domain, and then analysed them using model explainability with process mining principles to derive relevant inferences.\nDelivery Partner App\n \u2013 Enhancements to the UI/UX are critical in preventing many sources of misunderstanding for DPs, particularly to those who are new to the gig economy. On the app, the emphasis is on higher usage of navigation by providing seamless routing to it.\nOnboarding \n\u2013 Reinforced the usage of bike mobile holders by adding them to our onboarding kits. Initial training also included informative videos on how to use the DP app, as well as Google Maps navigation system tips and techniques.\nDelivery Partner Assignment System \n\u2013 As a byproduct of the feature engineering process, an equation-based ultra-fast ETA was created based on DP speed and medal features. This increased the compliance of the DP assignment system\u2019s predictions by 4 percent and enhanced DP assignment and dispatch.\nLocation\n \u2013 When the customer delivery location is snapped in the navigation system, it tends to be snapped on the nearest road rather than the road\u2019s entrance point. This makes last-mile delivery navigation confusing for delivery partners.\u00a0\nFuture Scope \u2013\nThe successful deployment of the base model in production provided us with a headway to improve in all directions. These incremental gains will come from digging deeper into tree depths and using a larger number of features as inputs to the model. These advancements also made it possible to use auxiliary models with specific goals, such as the monsoon model for rains or the quantile model for high-stress delivery.\nWe\u2019ll be working on upgrading the existing basic model into a larger ensemble with even higher accuracies in the coming weeks to capture these incremental gains.\nDisclaimer \u2013 We don\u2019t share our ETAs with our DPs or give them a countdown as it might create a sense of on-road urgency leading to rash driving. Additionally, in the above developments, we have increased our average predictions to adjust tolerance for our DPs to be within the predicted ETAs.\nThis blog was written in collaboration with \nShubh Chaurasia\n and \nSiddhartha Agnihotri\n.\nIf you found this to be an exciting problem to solve and would like to be a part of our engineering team, please reach out to me on \nLinkedIn\n."

        "content": "Before we even talk about this, we will start with a clarification \u2013\u00a0to fulfil our quick delivery promise, we do not put any pressure on delivery partners to deliver food faster. Nor do we penalise delivery partners for late deliveries. The delivery partners are not informed of the promised time of delivery. Time optimisation does not happen on the road, and does not put any lives at risk.\nThe fulfilment of our quick delivery promise relies on a dense finishing stations\u2019 network, which is located in close proximity to high-demand customer neighbourhoods. Sophisticated dish-level demand prediction algorithms, and future-ready in-station robotics are employed to ensure that your food is sterile, fresh and hot at the time it is picked by the delivery partner.\u00a0\nWhy 10-minute food delivery?\nCustomers are increasingly demanding quicker answers to their needs. They don\u2019t want to plan, and they don\u2019t want to wait. \nIn fact, sorting restaurants by fastest delivery time is one of the most used features on the Zomato app.\u00a0\nIn addition to that, after becoming a frequent customer of Blinkit (one of Zomato\u2019s investments in the quick commerce space), I started feeling that the 30-minute average delivery time by Zomato is too slow, and will soon \nhave to\n become obsolete. If we don\u2019t make it obsolete, someone else will.\u00a0\nInnovating and leading from the front is the only way to survive (and therefore thrive) in the tech industry. And here we are\u2026 with our 10-minute food delivery offering \u2013 \nZomato Instant\n.\nHow is this even going to happen?\nNobody in the world has so far delivered hot and fresh food in under 10 minutes at scale, and we were eager to be the first to create this category, globally!\u00a0\nWe deeply care about how we do what we do. So the first thing we told ourselves when we thought about instant food delivery was \u201cno compromises\u201d. We narrowed down to these eight principles around which we are building Zomato Instant\u2013\u00a0\n(Almost) as affordable as home-cooked food\nHighest quality of fresh food\nWorld class hygiene practices\nMinimal use of plastic packaging\nConvenient packaging for quick/easy consumption\u00a0\nTraceable supply chain (v2)\nDelivery partner safety\u00a0\nDeep collaboration with restaurant partners\nEach of our finishing stations will house bestseller items (~20-30 dishes) from various restaurants based on demand predictability and hyperlocal preferences. Luckily, the experience of having delivered 1.35 billion orders across India over the years makes our job a little easier.\nDue to demand predictability at a hyperlocal level, we expect that the price for the customer will get significantly reduced, while the absolute \u20b9 margin/income for our restaurant partners as well as our delivery partners, will remain the same.\nBetter food for more people\nWe are going to pilot Zomato Instant with four stations in Gurugram from next month onwards. This is one of the biggest endeavours towards our mission statement of \u201cbetter food for more people\u201d. We have always believed that in order to compete with home cooked food, restaurant food needs to work on the following four tenets \u2013\u00a0\nA\nffordability\u00a0\nA\nccessibility\nA\nssortment\nQ\nuality\nIn short, AAAQ. And if Zomato Instant works as envisioned, it will create significant impact on Affordability (at least 50% reduction in cost to the end customer), Accessibility (reduction of delivery time from 30 minutes average to under 10 minutes), and Quality (with influence over the supply chain, we will be able to ensure highest grade ingredients and hygiene practices across the supply chain).\u00a0\nAt Zomato, we believe that our best products are yet to come. We sincerely hope that Zomato Instant makes food experiences even more enjoyable."

        "author": "Ram Singla",
        "content": "\u201cA satisfied customer is the best business strategy of all\u201d \u2013 Michael Leboeuf\nIn this two-part series, we will explore how we engineer the Delivery Partner-ETA predictive model to navigate successfully around roadblocks like sparsity of road mapping and dense networks of inroads in smaller towns and cities.\u00a0\nPart 1: Identifying roadblocks to timely and accurate delivery of customer satisfaction\nBrand equity and customer loyalty are two very valuable currencies for a company. Timely and accurate delivery of brand promise is critical to customer satisfaction. In a food delivery ecosystem, the accurate prediction and low-cost computation of \nEstimated Time of Arrival (ETA) \nis a game-changer.\u00a0\nIt is a brand promise that makes or breaks the customer experience.\u00a0\nAt Zomato, ETA is at the heart of menu browsing, restaurant selection, delivery partner (DP) assignment, order tracking, and delay communication experiences. The Time Microservice owns the ETA computation and subsequently distributes this information to other services.\u00a0\nOur job is to set correct expectations with the customer and meet these expectations through a measure of punctuality and tolerance interval.\nZomato\u2019s ETA goes beyond Delivery Partner Travel Time (DP-ETA). It factors in the computation of additional components like Kitchen Preparation Time (KPT), real-time dynamic buffers, and localised DP arrival times.\u00a0\nDP-ETA is the transit time between the order pickup (restaurant location) and drop-zone-geo-fenced entry (customer location). While the DP-ETA is predicted in a feedforward method, \nreal-time dynamic buffers\n adjust the estimated arrival time based on factors such as customer demand, traffic, road closures and repairs, DP supply, local weather, and real-time stress observed in the system. DP-ETA serves as a compensator in a variety of situations.\u00a0\u00a0\nOn the contrary, highly precise values with low tolerance are more sensitive to dynamic settings, making them more error-prone in the event of disruptions such as traffic, diversions, and weather. Whereas the overstretched ETA and underpredictions have visible negative effects on customer metrics.\nHow do we engineer the DP-ETA predictive model?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Roadblocks:\nForecasting a DP\u2019s path is dependent on open-source maps and licensed map providers with routing engines. As we penetrate deeper into the city tier structure, the flaws in the representation of routing paths multiply. As some of these roads are less travelled and unexplored, road mapping can be severely inaccurate.\nWhile mapping the Indian landscape, older city districts (with some of the world\u2019s densest and most congested road networks) do not get computed and measured accurately.\u00a0The network of Indian roads is like arteries, connecting different paths to the destination. Still, the lack of accuracy can affect the computation of DP-ETA. If one factors in multiple makeshift roads and inroads, then it becomes difficult and confusing to calculate distance, direction, and travel time precisely.\nMore often than otherwise, DPs select this path based on their own judgement as they react to unpredictable circumstances and experiences on the road. As a consequence, the forecasted route could differ significantly from the exact route taken by the DP.\u00a0\nAs a response, Zomato switched to a tree-based prediction model from the previously used map-graph-based model.\u00a0\nPerformance Indicator\nPrecision is measured using the 2-minute and 5-minute accuracy-compliance matrix, the R2 (R Square) score, error standard deviation and MAE (Mean Absolute Error). The performance indicators on the customer side include ORS (Order Requiring Support), Extreme Delays (>20 minutes), and user flows such as search to cart, cart to order, etc.\nWhile in principle this made sense, we faced the following design challenges while building it as a\u00a0model \u2013\u00a0\nResponse Time \n\u2013 Predictions should be generated in milliseconds, that too on a CPU-based deployment for optimising costs. These low-latency predictions are required for our apps\u2019 smooth and lightning-fast scrolling\nThroughput \u2013\n The requirement is in thousands of QPS (Queries per second) with resilience towards spikes\nAccuracy \u2013\n Predictions should be substantially more accurate than the previous edition and should also pay more attention to catastrophic breaches and long-tail instances of delivery\nScalability \u2013\nVertical Scaling \n\u2013 To make this model one of the deepest tree models at Zomato, within the constraints of the latency requirement\nHorizontal Scaling \n\u2013 To democratise the ability to add additional models into an ensemble. Specialised objectives, such as a rain model or a quantile model, might be included in these models\nParsimony of the features \u2013\n To limit the number of features in the model in order to achieve high QPS and low inference latency. Features are input to the model and can represent particular states, properties, or traits\nStay tuned for part 2, where we will talk about eliminating these roadblocks.\nThis blog was written in collaboration with \nShubh Chaurasia\n and \nSiddhartha Agnihotri\n.\nIf you found this to be an exciting problem to solve and would like to be a part of our engineering team, please reach out to me on \nLinkedIn\n."

        "author": "Sajal Gupta",
        "content": "At Zomato, we serve millions of active customers in more than 700 cities in India. Such a\u00a0diverse spread means that our customers use a variety of devices to enjoy our services.\u00a0\nTo cater to this huge demand, we need to ensure speedy deliveries with a seamless app experience, across devices. And to achieve this, we look at two critical metrics: app open times and responsiveness.\u00a0\n\u2018App Open Time\u2019 refers to the time taken from tapping the app icon till the time the app is ready for customer interaction. When hungry customers have to wait for the app to load (even if it is a few microseconds), it can cause a lot of them to drop off, leading to an adverse effect on business.\nThe initial results of our optimisation efforts were not only promising but astounding. Further, with our expansion into tier-2 and tier-3 cities, we realised the need to deploy universally applicable solutions, which could be handled by devices with relatively limited processing capacity.\u00a0\nSo, what did we do?\nWe used a simple rule to analyse our overheads. We evaluated solutions based on their return on investment and the effort required to be put in by our engineering team. Based on this, we commenced a four-month-long optimisation and improvement journey.\nStep 1 \u2013 Aim for perfection with Perfetto\nPerfetto is a system profiling and app tracing tool by Google. It helps analyse the app by collecting system and app-level performance traces. After examining the traces, we noticed issues such as high inflation time and significant libraries load time in our app\u2019s performance and prioritised these issues through the low-effort-high-gain approach.\nLegacy SDKs and libraries took a significant amount of time in the app startup, so removing them was our priority. This exercise helped us improve the app startup time by ~20%.\nStep 2 \u2013 Laziness helps (sometimes)\nContent providers are initialised after the Application class but before Application\u2019s onCreate(). Many third-party (3P) libraries such as Facebook and Firebase use content providers\u2019 property to initialise themselves during the startup. This can cost the performance of any app unless these libraries are required on the app launch.\nApp startup library helps resolve this issue by providing an interface to order the libraries\u2019 initialisations, saving precious time. We mainly use Facebook SDK during the login process, so we removed its auto initialisation, and only initialised the SDK if the consumer selects the Facebook login method. This quick yet significant fix helped us reduce the startup time by ~6%.\nStep 3 \u2013 Stub them out\nWe focus on a custom startup time to analyse the app\u2019s performance. It\u2019s not just the Android\u2019s startup time but also extends to the point where customers can start interacting with the app. So, the next step was to improve the inflation time of the views. This was critical as the rendering and inflation of the view itself can take a significant amount of time in a complex UI structure like ours.\nFor this, we turned to ViewStub, which increased efficiency by creating views but only adding them to the view hierarchy if required. The optimal strategy here was to flatten the view hierarchy and merge layouts along with ViewStubs in the login activity. These changes significantly improved the inflation time by 7%.\nStep 4 \u2013 Cache me if you can\nAndroid Studio provides \nProfiler\n, a powerful tool to track CPU activity, memory usage, and trace analysis like Perfetto. In Profiler, we can take a deep look at the app\u2019s functioning unlike Perfetto, which mainly focuses on the broader view. We found some inefficiencies in our views and memory usage, so we tried to improve the caching mechanism and reuse the views as much as possible. Thanks to this, we achieved a massive \ndrop of 60%\n in out of memory issues.\u00a0\nQuick tips\u00a0\nTry not to use coroutines during the app startup phase as they take a significant amount of time to initialise. Instead, one can use ExecutorService to handle background tasks, as the Zygote process already initialises it, hence no overhead.\nAlways check the merged manifest file and find out those content providers that are not required at the startup phase.\nThese steps led to:\nPerformance gains, which helped us create a smoother customer experience.\u00a0\nUI improvements and reduced jank.\nA 20% uptick in customers landing on a fully-loaded and usable homepage. This flow is a key business metric at Zomato.\nAccording to Firebase Performance\u2019s cold startup metric, our app startup time improved by 25% on average, and for low-mid-range devices, by over 30%.\u00a0\n\u201cWorking on such a large scale app comes with its challenges, but we are always ready to explore new ways to improve the experience for our customers. This project helped us understand the performance metrics in a deeper manner. Tools like Profiler and Systrace can be overwhelming, but if one is aiming for a blazing-fast app, it\u2019s definitely worth the effort.\u201d\nShubham Pathak \u2013 Engineering Team\nThis blog was written in collaboration with \nShubham Pathak\n and \nAsheesh Sharma\n.\nAt Zomato, we are always 1% done. So, we continue to build an increasingly faster and smoother app experience for you and strive to be the most preferred and loved food delivery company.

        "content": "Amidst a period of near-term global uncertainty, we at Zomato remain focused on our long-term strategy of better serving our customers and our community. Our goal remains to be the preferred food company in India and we believe we are in a stronger position than ever before \u2013 confident in our recent execution and well capitalized for future growth.\nIn this letter, we will discuss three important topics \u2013\nLast quarter\u2019s performance\nRecapping the bigger picture for our food ordering and delivery business (given our short history as a listed company)\nOur capital allocation strategy going forward (including our thoughts on quick commerce)\nOur performance in the last quarter\n(Q3 FY22 update)\nAdjusted Revenue\n \u2013\u00a0on a year-on-year (\u201cYoY\u201d) basis, we saw a 78% growth in Adjusted Revenue to INR 14.2 billion ($190 million). On a sequential quarter-on-quarter (\u201cQoQ\u201d)\u00a0 basis, we saw a flat quarter.\u00a0\nAdjusted Revenue is the sum of Revenue from operations (from all businesses) and customer delivery charges in our food delivery business.\u00a0\nOur Revenue from operations grew by ~9% QoQ, while the customer delivery charges de-grew by 22%. This was driven by INR 7.5 per order reduction in customer delivery charges in Q3 FY22 as compared to Q2 FY22.\u00a0\nWe re-distributed our growth investments more in favor of discounts on customer delivery charges vis-a-vis food coupons. Why? We are seeing higher return on investment with discounted delivery charges as compared to coupons. As a result, discounts per order reduced by INR 5 per order in the last quarter as compared to Q2 FY22.\nPart of the reduction in customer delivery charges is also because we started operations in ~180 new cities (we are now in a total of 700+ cities), where we introduced temporary free delivery to cultivate a culture of ordering food from restaurants.\nCustomer delivery charges over the years have grown steadily as a strong validation of the convenience that our platform offers. Given the meaningful size of customer delivery charges today, we are now able to use this as a lever (in addition to food coupons) to drive growth on our platform.\nAdjusted EBITDA \nloss reduced to INR 2.7 billion ($36 million) in Q3 FY22 as compared to INR 3.1 billion ($41 million) in the previous quarter (Q2 FY22) driven by rationalizing spends across various businesses and functions.\u00a0\nGross Order Value (\u201cGOV\u201d)\n grew by 84.5% YoY and 1.7% QoQ to INR 55.0 billion ($733 million) in Q3 FY22.\u00a0\nWe believe that the weak QoQ growth in GOV was primarily due to reduction in customer delivery charges as mentioned above, in addition to a soft impact of post-covid reopening (including some shift from delivery to dining out).\u00a0\nNumber of orders\n grew 93% YoY and 5% QoQ. \nAverage order value\n (AOV, which includes customer delivery charges) shrunk by ~3% QoQ, mostly on account of reduction in customer delivery charges.\u00a0\nContribution as a % of GOV\n for our food delivery business was 1.1% in Q3 FY22 as compared to 1.2% in Q2 FY22.\nFew more KPIs below \u2013\nMagic of countdown \u2013 New Year\u2019s Eve\n\u00a0\nThe day of December 31 is usually our highest GOV day in a year. We exited the quarter on a high with our December 31, 2021 GOV at ~$18 million, which was ~78% higher than the same day last year. This is the highest YoY growth we have seen on December 31 in the past 3 years.\nWe are very proud of our tech, and how it held up during the highest peaks on New Year\u2019s Eve. We hit ~2.6 million orders on that day.\nGoing by past trends, our volume on New Year\u2019s Eve is a leading indicator of the growth we expect during the next year. \ud83e\udd1e\nHyperpure\n \nHyperpure is growing well and revenue from this business grew by 168% YoY and 40% QoQ to INR 1.6 billion ($21 million) in Q3 FY22. Hyperpure is now present in 9 cities and we supplied to over 27K unique restaurants in this quarter \u2013 up 50% from ~18k unique restaurants in Q2 FY22.\u00a0\nDining-out and Zomato Pro\nThe revival of in-restaurant dining in Q3 FY22 led to some green shoots in our dining-out ad-sales business. Our focus here for now is on improving our product and customer engagement while putting monetization on the backburner for a while.\nThe bigger picture\nZooming out from the current quarter, we remain focused on the bigger picture and the long-term growth potential of our food ordering and delivery business in the years ahead.\u00a0 Zomato continues to benefit from the changes we are helping to drive in the overall restaurant industry.\nThe consumption of restaurant food has grown manifold in India on the back of higher accessibility, choice and affordability of restaurant food. The restaurant industry in India is highly fragmented with ~90% of the revenue coming from standalone restaurants and only ~10% from chains. In this ecosystem, we have played our part by helping small restaurants level the playing field for themselves and get discovered by new customers.\u00a0\nAs a result, average monthly active food delivery restaurants have grown by 6x and average monthly transacting customers have grown by 13x on Zomato over the past 5 years.\nAs we match supply and demand of restaurant food on our platform, the food delivery GOV has grown by 17x on Zomato over the past 5 years.\nAs new customers age on our platform, we have seen their ordering frequency go up.\u00a0\nAlong with frequency, the average order value (AOV) has inched up over the last couple of years to ~INR 400 as the business is showing early signs of maturity.\nProfitability\n \u2013 over the years, unit economics in our food delivery business have improved with scale.\n Contribution margin (as a % of GOV) has improved steadily from \u201315% back in 2019 days to 1% today.\n A ~5% contribution margin in our food delivery business (at the current scale) should get us to EBITDA break-even as a company (covering all common corporate costs as well).\u00a0\nCapital allocation\nWe are currently well capitalized with ~$1.7 billion cash on our balance sheet, and we don\u2019t envisage raising cash in the foreseeable future. With this capital, we plan to focus on two key areas of investment in our business \u2013\u00a0\nCore food businesses\n \u2013 including food ordering and delivery, dining-out and our B2B supplies business Hyperpure. We will need to continue to fund the growth investments here till the business becomes profitable.\u00a0\nQuick commerce \n\u2013\n \nthis category offers a huge addressable market and is also very synergistic with our food delivery business in the long term giving us a right to win over standalone players.\nWe made cash investments worth ~$225 million in the past year across three companies \u2013 Blinkit\n \n(erstwhile Grofers), Shiprocket and Magicpin \u2013\n \ntowards our objective of building out quick e-commerce in India.\nOf these investments, Blinkit is the closest to how we all know the quick commerce business today. Blinkit pioneered 10-minute grocery delivery in India post our ~$100 million investment in August 2021. Since then, the platform has scaled rapidly to ~$450 million annual run rate GMV (January 2022 annualized) and now operates with 400+ dark stores across 20 cities in India. 100% of Blinkit\u2019s business now is in quick commerce format with a median delivery time of ~12 minutes. Delightful customer experience is leading to high customer retention, ordering frequency and willingness to pay for the service.\u00a0\nWe are very bullish on the product-market fit, unit economics, as well as the growth trajectory of the quick commerce category. It reminds us of the food delivery category a few years ago when many platforms competed over a large and growing market but ultimately only the few who delivered exceptional experience to their customers survived. We are becoming increasingly confident in our decision to invest behind market leadership here with healthy unit economics. As a result, we are updating the upper bound of our potential investments in this category to $400m cash over the next two years.\nOne question we are often asked \u2013 \u201care you going to continue making investments in more companies (in the two categories above) in the future?\u201d\nYes, we want to continue making minority equity investments in businesses that will accelerate growth of our business. We aim to work together with founders of other companies in a symbiotic relationship and utilize their expertise to strengthen and support our business. In an otherwise competitive VC ecosystem, trust and partnership drive our investments and being one of the top internet companies in India makes us a partner of choice for other founders.\u00a0\nAlso, we are in the process of setting-up our own non-banking financial company (NBFC) which will allow us to extend short term credit to our ecosystem \u2013\u00a0our delivery partners, customers and restaurant partners. We believe we can add significant value to, and improve the experience of, our platform partners with this initiative without requiring Zomato to allocate significant capital. Over the next few years, our focus will remain creating a great experience for our stakeholders and helping to grow our overall ecosystem rather than optimizing for revenues or profits.\nThat is it from our side, for now.\u00a0\nAs always, we remain grateful to our shareholders, who believe in us and in the long-term view of our business.\u00a0\nStay well,\nDeepinder (Founder & CEO) and Akshant (CFO)\nNote: If you have any questions or clarifications or want to talk to us, please write to \nshareholders@zomato.com\n.\nAnnexure\nAdjusted Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation\u00a0\nThe following table reconciles audited revenue from operations and stated loss for the period (as per IND AS) with Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.\nINR / USD exchange rate assumed to be at 75\nZomato Limited\u2019s financial year ends on 31 March of every year\nGlossary"

        "content": "To say that NYE is a busy time for us at Zomato is an understatement. Every year, we begin preparing for high order volumes keeping the previous year as our baseline. In 2020, we hit \nover 4,000\n orders per minute (OPM) on NYE. In 2021, we delivered almost double that number per minute, surpassing our highest expectations. But there\u2019s still a long way to go as India trusts us to deliver their favourite food all year round.\nThere are many pieces that stitch the experience of a single order together \u2014 right from when you run a search, put in filters, build your order, make payment, get an estimate of the delivery time, to tracking the delivery partner and making sure the order reaches you on time.\nWe make sure our customers have the best experience possible. But when the traffic actually hits, even the best-laid plans can go haywire. Thinking on our feet and keeping the experience smooth for the customers is our main priority, but monitoring all the metrics to ensure we don\u2019t drop the ball for each order delivered on NYE is like Keanu Reeves dodging those bullets in \nThe Matrix.\u00a0\nWhich is why we thought, what better than to share more about our experience with the tech community out there:\nNYE is one of the most important days for us. Every system is stretched to its limit, be it services, databases, or logistics. Preparations start weeks in advance. From preparing projections to latency optimisation to system scale-up, NYE then becomes a waiting game as to when we will break our previous highs of throughput and OPM.\n by \nSumanshu Dwivedi \u2013 Data Platforms and Logistics Tech Team\nEven my two monitors and a laptop screen were not enough for the numbers I was monitoring that day. The focus was on ensuring the error rate remained below the threshold. The chills from a small abnormality in data, or the happiness of breaking multiple records, all are one hell of a learning experience.\nDue to the impeccable preparation by the android team before NYE the statistics ended up even better than we expected.\nby \nAsheesh Sharma \u2013 Android Team\u00a0\nOn NYE, we wanted to serve as many customers as we could, while maintaining a good ordering experience. For that, we had to throttle demand at places where the delivery partner availability and the restaurant kitchen bandwidth were quickly getting consumed as orders started flooding in. Having an automated demand management system wasn\u2019t enough, we took manual control of this at times.\nby \nPraveen Omar \u2013 Delivery Partner Experience Team\u00a0\nThe \nover 2.5 million orders\n we serviced on NYE came from across the globe. People from different parts of the world were ordering food for loved ones in India. So, our customer support was dealing with a global audience. The high order volume meant we had to steer the ship without the help of machines at times. But given the level of preparation we had made, it was all par for the course.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe iOS team was well-prepared for NYE with a stable release on the App Store, and setting up alerts for order flow in case something goes wrong. We were continuously checking our crashes, out-of-memory sessions, API failures, and business metrics to ensure our customers have the best ordering experience.\nby \nAditya Jain \u2013 iOS Team\u00a0\nIt was like the final exam for which you have been preparing for weeks. If you prepare well, the numbers thrill you, not scare you. It was quite exhilarating for me, but I had to pay attention to all the customer feedback. Listening to our customers\u2019 feedback in real-time while helping our customer support team opened my eyes to so many unsolved things.\nby \nRitesh Dalal \u2013 Restaurant Partner Experience Team\u00a0\nOn NYE, we were tense with questions; will mongo remain performant? Can MQTT handle the load? We tested our systems at 10x the load that we expected during NYE. We had been capturing the production traffic after amplification and randomization of the data. We wanted to load the system in exactly the same manner as anticipated on NYE. We tested by replaying the same data on a production clone. Our in-house platform \u2018\nOne Support\n\u2019 performed exactly the same way as anticipated on NYE. \nThankfully, all our planning and efforts paid off, and we saw the highest ever order volume.\nby \nKumar Gyanendra- Customer Experience Team\u00a0\nIt was all about monitoring cities driving the largest volume for various business metrics and making real-time configuration changes wherever we noticed the system breaking. The increased order volume also had me worried about spikes in memory or processing time leading to unexpected crashes. Being in a state of \u201call systems alert\u201d is a big part of running NYE smoothly.\nby \nTushar Dudani \u2013 Order Fulfilment Team\nPreparation for the scale we achieved on NYE and the non-existent margin of error helped us flush out a lot of kinks from our systems. Tuning all circuit breakers, having kill switches for each feature, finding bottlenecks for each database and their mitigation strategies were just a few among the many tasks we had to do to be ready for the NYE.\nby \nYasoob Haider \u2013 Food Delivery Search Team\nWe were all hands on deck to monitor the order-level metrics of our restaurant partners. To run a large operation like this, we are dependent on multiple external service providers too. So while it is easier to plan for things in our direct control, it is equally important to anticipate possible breakpoints at the end of our service providers. We faced disruption when our third-party call provider\u2019s services were impacted, however, we were able to minimise the impact on our orders by quickly switching to an alternate service provider.\u00a0\nBecause there was no room for error, we prepared for, well, the apocalypse. We had a code to crack every foreseeable and unforeseeable problem.\u00a0\nby \nSatyaprakash Dwibedi \u2013 Restaurant Partner Engineering Team\u00a0\nOne must always be prepared for the unexpected on NYE. As a developer, you should be always prepared to have a fallback mechanism on what to do if anything goes wrong. Every line of code has its own importance in solving problems, so think about that while building products.\nby \nPraneel Rathore \u2013 Customer Experience Team\nNYE is a big day for our restaurant partners; not only do all services have to be provided timely, but every product needs to operate seamlessly. On such a day, real-time logging and system monitoring is key \u2013 keeping a close eye on timed out orders and requests, the orders per minute rate, and the successful relay of orders to our POS vendors, kept us on our toes. Given the scale we were operating at, many things could break, but the anxiety is all worth it when we see improved statistics every year.\nby \nTushar Mohan \u2013 Restaurant Partner Engineering Team\u00a0\nOn NYE there is a massive traffic surge for payments which is why we keep our systems scaled to handle peak loads. The major challenge during NYE dinner peak is to handle the downtimes at different payment gateways, providers and networks routing traffic with minimal damage so as to provide a seamless payment experience across multiple payment methods for our customers.\nby \nSahil Arya \u2013 Payments Engineering Team\nWe strive to keep the systems up and running flawlessly 100% of the time. NYE reinforces that building feature toggles and kill switches should be a habit and not an event prep toolkit. Database, cache queries and other IO operations should also be metricised.\u00a0\nWhile it is always important to code the \u201cright way\u201d without compromising on customer experience, on such important and high volume days, the equation changes a bit for hot-fixes. You need to prioritise experience rather than building stuff the right way.\u00a0\nby \nGaurav Gupta \u2013 Restaurant Partner Experience Team\nA look at the last day of 2021\nWhat goes on during the last day of the year at Zomato is a different rush altogether. Every year, our customers surpass our expectations. It is these challenges we thrive on. Because nothing gives us greater pleasure than solving real problems for our customers. \nSo keep the \norders\n, and the \nchallenges\n, \ncoming\n!"

        "content": "Zomato grows when our Restaurant Partners grow. So we constantly ask ourselves \u2013 what does it take for a great restaurant to grow further and faster? We believe it is a combination of great food, exceptional customer service, entrepreneurial team, loved brand, and easy access to capital. Ideally, capital should seamlessly follow any great restaurant, but in reality, it is not easy for restaurants in India to raise funding through growth-focused equity investors. While some large chains have attracted investors, we have barely scratched the surface \u2013 in the last three years, only about 25 restaurants and cloud-kitchens saw Series A or larger equity funding rounds, as per Tracxn. There are thousands of budding restaurants that may not have the expertise or focus to fundraise at the right time from the right investors. This is where we want to help.\nWe are excited to announce the launch of Zomato Wings, a platform to connect investors with restaurants. Just like ambitious restaurant entrepreneurs look for investors, investors also hunt for brands and teams that have the potential to become the next big chain. We at Zomato have seen the growth story of such restaurants first hand. By curating a set of restaurants and cloud-kitchens that could become rocketships if fuelled with equity capital, we hope to build the go-to platform for venture capital firms, angel investors, family offices, etc. that are looking to make private investments in restaurants and cloud-kitchens.\u00a0\nAs we partner with more investors by connecting them with enterprising restaurants, more budding restaurants would use this platform for fundraising, and the platform\u2019s flywheel would create a win-win for restaurants and investors, and by extension, for Zomato!\nWill Zomato invest in these deals? We would have loved to! We have strong conviction in the imminent success of so many of our restaurant partners, and nothing would give us more joy than becoming closer partners. However, we are mindful that by owning an equity stake in one brand, we may raise some concern among other brands. Again, we do not want to compete with restaurants, and want to remain a fair and neutral platform for all restaurants.\u00a0\nZomato\u2019s role would be limited to being a facilitator of fundraising for restaurants. We will help restaurants position their story and metrics in the right manner and connect them with the right investors.\nIs your restaurant brand ready to fly? Get in touch with your account manager if you believe your business can grow exponentially if backed by the right investors. If you are an institutional investor looking for a hidden gem that could be the next unicorn of the restaurant industry, reach out to us at \nwings@zomato.com\n. We hope to give wings to at least 100 restaurant brands in the next three years \u2013 join us in this exciting growth story!"

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "India is at an inflection point for internet businesses. Between the years 2012 and 2020, India saw 25 private companies which were valued at more than $1 billion (popularly known as unicorns). This calendar year so far, we have seen 35 new unicorns in India. While there is a lot of chatter about this being a \u2018bubble\u2019, a closer look at most of these companies will tell you that real revenue, real growth, and a real revolution in India is underway. We believe the next 10 years in the Indian internet ecosystem will be unprecedented and will create a tremendous amount of wealth and progress for our country.\u00a0\nThis has fuelled our ambitions further and we are now thinking about how we can create a $10 billion business by revenue in a few years time. The paradigm for India has changed within a year and that gives us a new opportunity to build a much bigger Zomato than what we dreamt of a year ago.\nBefore we delve into our performance for the last quarter, we want to share our updated thinking for the long term success and compounding growth of our business.\nThe long term view of our business\nIn this section, we will cover the three main parts of our long term strategy\nBrutal prioritisation\n \u2013 divest or shut down any businesses which aren\u2019t likely to drive exponential value for our shareholders in the long term\nInvest in our core food businesses and the ecosystem around it\n to make it a robust long term value driver\nBuild the hyperlocal e-commerce ecosystem\n by leveraging our key strengths to invest and partner with other companies to tap into growth opportunities beyond food\nBrutal prioritisation \u2013 divesting or shutting down non-core businesses\nOur core food related businesses \u2013 a) food ordering and delivery, b) dining-out, and c) hyperpure (B2B supplies for restaurants) will remain the key value drivers for Zomato for the next few years. These are all complex businesses and we want our entire team to stay focused on these most important value drivers for our business.\u00a0\nKeeping this in mind, we are in the process of divesting or shutting down our non-core businesses which were not going to significantly move the needle for our shareholders in the long term. All of these businesses, that we are divesting or shutting down, contributed less than 1% to our Adjusted Revenue and 13% to our Adjusted EBITDA loss in Q2 FY22.\nThe divestment vs shutdown debate starts and ends with two questions \u2013 a) Can we sell the business to someone for whom it is core, and can they realise disproportionate returns from what we have built? b) Is the divestment process worth the value that we will realise from the divestment? Fitso checked these boxes on divestment and we are in the process of selling Fitso to Curefit (Curefit Healthcare Pvt Ltd) for $50 million. In order to cultivate a great long term partnership with Curefit, we are also investing cash in Curefit. Net $50 million cash investment plus value of the Fitso business (worth $50 million) will give us a cumulative shareholding worth $100 million in Curefit (6.4% shareholding in Curefit). This will help us potentially explore cross-selling benefits between Zomato and Curefit, as we see food and health becoming the same side of the coin in the long term.\nWe have shut down our direct-to-consumer (\u201cD2C\u201d) experiment in Nutraceuticals. Instead, we are choosing to back a platform play for all D2C brands (by investing in Shiprocket; more on this later). We are also shutting down our operations in Lebanon, which is the only international business we were left with (other than dining-out business in UAE) after shutting down the rest of our international operations last year.\u00a0\nInvest in our core food businesses and the ecosystem around it\nOur mainstay food ordering and delivery business is an opportunity where we expect huge shareholder value creation going forward. We believe that the food delivery market in India is still nascent, and there is an opportunity to grow the market at least 10x over the next few years. In order to make this happen, we are going to continue investing heavily in market creation, in addition to investing in ecosystem companies around our food delivery business so that the cost of running a better food delivery business goes down with time. We are currently in talks with various restaurant point-of-sale (POS) players, e-vehicle fleet operators, among others, to evaluate investments in these companies keeping the long term in mind.\nDining-out is still recovering from the shockwaves of COVID-19, and it will take a few months for the dining-out sector to get back on the growth path it was on pre-COVID. We continue investing in product development and working with our restaurant partners to get the industry back in shape easier and faster.\nHyperpure is growing well, and we are excited about what it can become. We are building this business with first principles discipline, and are planning to invest upwards of $50 million in this business over the next 18-24 months. We will dive deeper into the growth and shape of our Hyperpure business in one of the shareholder letters in the next couple of quarters.\u00a0\nBuild the hyperlocal e-commerce ecosystem by investing and partnering with other companies to tap into growth beyond food\u00a0\nOur business today is at the confluence of food and hyperlocal e-commerce. What powers our business is the last mile hyperlocal delivery fleet, which is now 300,000+ delivery partners strong on a monthly active basis. We believe that our last mile fleet is a strong moat and it sets us up well for building one of the most meaningful hyperlocal e-commerce companies in India in the long term. We are bullish about the various use cases that we can plug our delivery fleet into, and we think we can be the primary contenders for building large businesses in hyperlocal e-commerce in India. Keeping this long term view in mind, we have started investing in hyperlocal e-commerce companies (including e-commerce enablers). Over time, the idea is to add multiple large core businesses to the existing core. Here\u2019s how we envision this to work \u2013\u00a0\nAs these businesses scale, we would want to be the provider of additional capital to these businesses and consolidate our stake leading to a potential merger at some point (at least in some cases, if and when the founders of these companies want to). In the worst case, we would want these investments to generate huge learnings and great financial returns for Zomato.\u00a0\nWe want to take an investment route to building these businesses instead of building them in-house. This strategy is inspired by the likes of Alibaba and Tencent, where they invested behind the ecosystem at large, created multiple M&A options for themselves, and in the worst case of M&A not panning out, realised windfall financial gains from their investments in market leaders across different categories.\nAll our investments are a mix of math and chemistry. We are only investing behind founders we believe have the ability to create market leaders in their spaces \u2013 so much so that we don\u2019t think we will ourselves be able to create similar businesses in-house that will beat the companies we are investing behind. Along with infusing capital into these category leaders, we will explore synergies and areas of collaboration amongst these partner companies to drive the best outcomes for the entire ecosystem including our partner companies.\nWithin all the businesses that we are looking at today, quick-commerce (delivery of products in less than 30 minutes) is clearly emerging as one of the most promising ones. While we decided to not build quick-commerce on our platform, we are excited about the progress our partner company Grofers has made in the 10-min delivery space. High online grocery penetration has remained elusive in India for the past 7-8 years but we feel we might be finally witnessing the inflection point here with the widespread adoption we are seeing in the 10-min delivery format. We are likely to invest more in this space in the near term.\nIn addition to our planned investment in Curefit as mentioned earlier as part of the Fitso divestment, we are making two new minority investments \u2013\nWe have signed definitive documents for investing ~$75 million in Bigfoot Retail Solutions Pvt Ltd (\n\u201cShiprocket\u201d\n) for a ~8% stake as part of a larger ~$185 million round. Shiprocket is a B2B logistics-tech company that enables online commerce by providing seamless shipping and fulfillment services to direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands and omni-channel sellers. It currently serves over 60,000+ brands and merchants across categories such as apparel, electronics, beauty and personal care, grocery, among others.\u00a0\nWe have also signed definitive documents for investing ~$50 million in Samast Technologies Pvt Ltd (\n\u201cmagicpin\u201d\n) for a ~16% stake as part of a total round size of $60m. magicpin drives omni-channel growth for local retailers. It has a network of 170,000+ paying merchants in categories including fashion, food, electronics, grocery, pharma, entertainment across 50 cities in India.\nIncluding our $100 million investment in Grofers earlier in August 2021, we have now committed $275 million across 4 companies over the past six months. We plan to deploy another $1 billion over the next 1-2 years, with a large chunk of it likely to go into the quick-commerce space.\nReflections on our performance in the last quarter\n[Q2 FY22 and H1 FY22 results update]\nThe COVID-19 situation improved significantly for India in the last quarter after a devastating second-wave in Q1 FY22. Number of new COVID-19 cases have come down dramatically \u2013 thanks to a phenomenal effort by the central and state governments and our healthcare community in getting large parts of our population vaccinated. In less than a year, India has managed to administer 1 billion+ vaccinations, covering 75% of the eligible population with at least one dose and 30% with both the doses.\u00a0\nSomewhere over the last quarter, we came to a conclusion that remote work cannot be the primary work mode if we want to build an enduring business. We believe that while remote work is employee friendly, it is not customer friendly. We are all here to serve our customers in the best way possible, and remote work led to all of us missing a lot of little things. And we believe these little things define the difference between good and great. To get our people back into the office, we initiated vaccination camps for our employees and their families, and are now proud to say that our headquarter in Gurugram is fully operational with every employee vaccinated, and RAT/RT-PCR tests are being conducted for every person once a week. We believe this is the new normal where people are primarily working out of a shared space, but still have the flexibility to go remote a few days/weeks in a year whenever someone needs a change in environment. Most of our employees are happier working live from the office \u2013 they now value the benefits of social interactions and in-person coaching and learning \u2013 something that we all used to take for granted pre-COVID.\u00a0\nBack to business, we saw the restaurant industry bouncing back nicely in Q2 FY22. Overall customer traffic on our platform in India increased to 59 million average monthly active users (India MAU) in Q2 FY22 as compared to 45 million in Q1 FY22. As we head into the festive season, we believe that almost all the restaurants across the country are open for business today. The restaurant industry was one of the most severely impacted sectors from the COVID-19 pandemic and it gives us immense joy to see the restaurant community getting back up on their feet after a prolonged phase of uncertainty for the past 18 months.\u00a0\nAdjusted Revenue\n \nin Q2 FY22 was INR 14.2 billion ($189 million), a 22.6% growth quarter-over-quarter (\u201cQoQ\u201d) and 144.9% growth year-over-year (\u201cYoY\u201d).\u00a0\nAdjusted Revenue for H1 FY22 was INR 25.8 billion ($344 million), a sequential growth of 50.1% over H2 FY21 and 178.2% YoY growth over H1 FY21.\nAdjusted EBITDA loss increased to INR 3.1 billion ($41 million) in Q2 FY22 as compared to INR 1.7 billion ($22 million) in the previous quarter (Q1 FY22) and INR 0.7 billion ($10 million) in Q2 FY21 last year. \u00a0\u00a0\nOn a half-yearly basis, Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to -18% in H1 FY22 as compared to -12% in the previous half-year (H2 FY21) and -13% in H1 FY21 last year.\u00a0\nWhy did our losses go up? This was due to investments in the growth of our food delivery business. Three reasons to be specific \u2013 a) increased spending on branding and marketing for customer acquisition, b) increased investments and growing share of smaller/emerging geographies in our business (which are less profitable today compared to more mature cities) and c) increased delivery costs due to unpredictable weather and increase in fuel prices.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s dive deeper into the performance of our food delivery business to understand this better.\nIndia food delivery\nIndia food delivery Gross Order Value (\u201cGOV\u201d) in Q2 FY22 grew by 19% QoQ and 158% YoY to INR 54.1 billion ($721 million). This growth was driven by an increase in the number of transacting users, number of active food delivery restaurants and active delivery partners on our platform, as can be seen from the table below.\u00a0\nIn line with GOV growth, Adjusted Revenue for India food delivery grew by 20.7% QoQ to INR 12.5 billion ($166 million). This represents ~88% of the total Adjusted Revenue for our company in the same quarter.\nWe can attribute a large part of the increase in transacting users (and adjusted revenue) to an increase in branding and marketing expenses. During Q2 FY22, we invested incremental ~INR 0.4 billion ($5.4 million) in branding and marketing as compared to Q1 FY22. Most of these spends were on television and digital marketing. The idea was to capitalize on the COVID-led Q1 FY22 growth momentum and acquire more new users as well as get a large number of lapsed users back on our platform. While this resulted in our losses expanding further, we believe this was a great opportunity to double down on expanding our user base cost efficiently. Please note that these expenses are not included in the definition of Contribution (they are below Contribution).\nOn the profitability front, the Contribution as a % of GOV was 1.2% in Q2 FY22 as compared to 2.8% in Q1 FY22. The reduction in Contribution margin is on account of the following \u2013\nIncreased investments in growth geographies \u2013 growing share of smaller, emerging cities in our business, which are currently less profitable than the more mature cities\u00a0\nIncrease in delivery cost per order (~INR 5 per order increase in Q2 FY22 as compared to Q1 FY22)\nAfter a hiatus of two years, we have started launching food delivery in new cities again. Over the years, we have seen the penetration of food delivery grow in emerging cities. To start with, these emerging cities are both demand and supply deficient but that changes once we help kick-off the demand-supply flywheel in a particular city. We do this by incentivizing the customers to try restaurant food and once habit formation starts kicking-in, we see more restaurants opening-up which in turn leads to more demand as customers get more choices. Over time, as this flywheel matures, we see a rapid growth in the order frequency as well as profitability of a particular city.\u00a0\nTo substantiate this point further, we see a ~30% higher ordering frequency and significantly higher Contribution margin in cities which have a meaningfully higher \u2018restaurants per 100k customers\u2019 metric.\u00a0\nWe are investing in seeding more of these emerging cities today and giving them enough time to grow into large and profitable markets for us in the years to come.\u00a0\nWhile Cohort B cities continue to grow rapidly (58% GOV growth over the past 2 quarters), their share of total GOV on our platform has shrunk by 2 percentage points in the same period as the pace of growth of emerging cities is much higher.\nThe delivery cost per order increased by INR 5 per order in Q2 FY22 as compared to Q1 FY22. This was on account of the following \u2013\nProlonged and unpredictable rainy season (which still continues in many parts of the country, oddly)\nSharp increase in fuel prices\nWe don\u2019t expect the delivery costs to go up further and overall feel confident about our Contribution margin staying positive in the mid, as well as long term.\nDining-out and Hyperpure\nWhile restaurants have started opening-up for dining-out, revenue from dining-out ad-sales in India continues to remain small since the COVID-19 outbreak last year. It will take a while for restaurants to start spending on ads again as they cautiously get back to operations.\u00a0\nAt the same time, opening-up of restaurants has made the Zomato Pro membership more valuable for customers since that unlocks the second leg of benefits for them in addition to the benefits they get on food delivery. As a quick recap, Zomato Pro is a customer membership program where customers pay us for quarterly/annual membership and as members they get deals and discounts at partner restaurants \u2013 both while eating at these restaurants as well as when they order food. These discounts are funded by our restaurant partners as they see incremental growth coming out of being a Zomato Pro restaurant partner. We also launched Zomato Pro Plus last quarter which is an invite only membership with additional benefit of free delivery on all orders. Unlike in case of Zomato Pro, the free delivery in case of Zomato Pro Plus is funded by Zomato. Between Zomato Pro and Pro Plus, we now have 1.5 million members and over 25k restaurant partners in India as at the end of Q2 FY22.\nLast but not the least, revenue from our B2B supplies business Hyperpure grew by 49% QoQ to INR 1.1 billion ($15 million) in Q2 FY22. Hyperpure is now present in 8 cities and we supplied to over 12,000 restaurants every month on an average in Q2 FY22.\u00a0\nThat is it from our side, for now.\u00a0\nOne last thing \u2013\u00a0we have heard that a public listing changes a number of things for companies. We are adamant that we will not let our IPO change anything, and we aren\u2019t going to morph into a QSQT business (\n\u2018quarter-se-quarter-tak\u2019\n). We will continue to focus relentlessly on the long term.\nAs always, we remain grateful to our shareholders, who have believed in us and in the long-term view of our business.\u00a0\nStay well,\nDeepinder (Founder & CEO) and Akshant (CFO)\nNote: If you have any questions or clarifications, please write to \nshareholders@zomato.com\n.\nAnnexure\nAdjusted Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation\u00a0\nThe following table reconciles audited revenue from operations and stated loss for the period (as per IND AS) with Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.\nINR / USD exchange rate assumed to be at 75\nZomato Limited\u2019s financial year ends on 31 March of every year\nGlossary"

Came in 6 years back not knowing what this would turn out to be. And what a mind blowing and amazing journey this has been. Feel proud of where we are today, what we have overcome to get here and feel even more proud of what we will achieve in the future.\nI have always been asked this question \u2013 where does all this energy come from and what keeps you going? Answer is simple and very unique to us \u2013 from all you amazing people and how this bunch comes together to create magic.\nI am taking a new turn in my life and will be starting a new chapter, taking a lot from this defining chapter of my life \u2013 the last 6 years at Zomato. We have a great team now to take Zomato forward and it\u2019s time for me to take an alternate path in my journey. I am very emotional as I write this and don\u2019t think any words can do justice to how I am feeling right now.\u00a0\nI couldn\u2019t have asked for more \u2013 I am so grateful for all the experiences I have had and thankful to all the folks around me for helping me become a much better person. I won\u2019t be able to stay away from all of you and you will see me around and in action every once in a while. How can I not be there for the town halls \u2013 \naisa to ho hi nahin sakta \ud83d\ude09\u00a0\nThank you Deepi for making me a part of this journey.

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/defining-our-typography-system/",
        "author": "Vijay Verma",
        "content": "A good typography system has the power to string together every element of a product interface. \nAdditionally, it helps create a distinction between represented use-cases, and maintains the aesthetic value of a brand at all times. And that\u2019s exactly what we were aiming to achieve with our typography system at Zomato.\u00a0\nWhile we were formulating typography guidelines for our very own design system, \nSushi\n, we decided to put down a few tips and tricks that may help you scale your typography across multiple apps and devices. All this, without complicating the handoff between designers and developers.\nDefining the typography style\nThe first step in this process is to define a type system that is extensible enough to cater to one\u2019s dynamic needs and requirements.\u00a0\nIn word processors, design programs, and even HTML/CSS, we\u2019re used to having pre-set typography, including everything from font weight, line height to colour, and even spacing. However, to develop a customised typography system, the following properties need to be defined at the very beginning \u2013\u00a0\nFont family\nFont weight\nFont size\nLine height\nLetter spacing, paragraph spacing, and indentation\nDecoration (strikethrough and underline)\nTransform (uppercase and lowercase)\nTheme (colour)\nAnd then, the two most important steps need to be followed \u2013\u00a0\nSelecting a typeface\nDeciding on a type scale and hierarchy\n1. Selecting a typeface\nA typeface is a simple collection of letters.\u00a0\nMost brands that we know of, have their own default typefaces that need to be used when designing. Apple, for example, uses the typeface San Francisco. Google Material Design on the other hand refers to Roboto, and our own design system utilises the primary typeface, Okra.\nInitially, we built our typography system based on Circular Std, which is very popular in the modern geometric typeface category. However, we wanted to ensure that we create a system that is scalable enough to support the unique requirements of our app.\nAfter exploring a few options, we decided on Metropolis \u2013\u00a0an open-source geometric typeface \u2013\u00a0as the best font to support our use-case. We simply adopted Metropolis, modified it according to our requirements, and named it \nOkra\n.\n1.1 Determining the basic terminology\nFor most people, the terms \u2018font\u2019 and \u2018typeface\u2019 are often used interchangeably. However, these are completely different. A typeface represents the parent category of a font. A single typeface can have multiple fonts as part of it, with slight differences in the look and feel of each.\nTypeface\n: The collection of letters and shapes. Example: Arial\nFont\n: The combination of a typeface and its different properties such as size, spacing, weight, etc. Example: We can choose many different fonts within Arial, such as \nitalic\n or \nbold\n.\nFont Family\n: A collection of all related fonts. \u00a0\n1.2 Classifying the typeface\nThere are many typefaces out there, but all fall under five basic categories \u2013\u00a0\nSerif: \nWithin fonts,\n \nSerif refers to the small features that appear at the ends of their strokes.\nSans Serifs:\n Sans is a French word meaning \u2018without\u2019. Hence, fonts characterised as \u2018Sans Serif\u2019 do not include serifs or features that appear at the ends of their strokes.\nHand Lettered\n \n(Script)\n: Such fonts have a natural, handwritten feel.\nMonospace\n: All characters within such a font have the same width.\nDisplay: \nSuch fonts are\n \nonly suitable for use at large point sizes.\nDepending on the requirement of a particular system, typefaces are selected for their legibility, accessibility and readability. A design system may have only one typeface or can be paired with another typeface to make it more extensible.\u00a0\n2. Deciding on a typescale, and hierarchy\nA typographic scale is utilised to simply build a balanced font sizing across one\u2019s design system.\n2.1 Visual hierarchy\nAs part of any design project, the visual hierarchy guides customers and helps them view areas that are of prime importance. The visual weight defines the importance of an element on a page, communicating to a viewer what they should focus on, and in what order.\nType sizes and weights are also defined with the following rules of thumb \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\nRegular weights are best for the minimum 11\u201319px range\nMain headline should be \nbold\n, not light\nBut sometimes, taking a case-by-case decision helps in fitting together elements more aesthetically.\u00a0\nIn order to derive other font size values that are harmonious in nature, we simply need to experiment with values greater than the minimum base font size, which is 11px. During this process, we should gradually test with other font size values from the same set, such as 12px, 13px, and so on.\u00a0\nOne good way to find the required pattern for the next font size is to audit the old UI screens and choose the type of scale accordingly.\nFollowing this rule, we finalised on the font size for our Sushi design system \u2013 11px, 12px, 13px, 15px, 17px, 19px, 21px, 24px, 27px.\n2.2 Scaling for device size\nAll typography systems must include responsive type sizes across different device size breakpoints.\nLine height\nLine heights across all font sizes must be proportional to one another in order to build a good vertical pattern. To accomplish this, one way is to use the same base line height/base font size ratio for deriving all other line heights.\u00a0\nStandard line height is 150% of the font size or base font size/base line height.\n2.3 Determining the naming convention\nType names can help designers and developers understand when and where to use a certain text style.\nPreset styling\n: Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3, Body Text, and so on. We must already be familiar with these as word processors or HTML/CSS tend to use these frequently.\nT-shirt size based scaling\n: T-Shirt size scaling is very common. Such a convention includes text or body as \u2013 \nsmall\n, \nmedium\n, \nlarge,\n \nand if one requires, \nxs\n,\n xl\n and so on.\u00a0\nShopify\u2019s Polaris is using this naming convention. Even though this works well as a naming convention for most systems, it is not the most scalable solution for every use-case. If we want to add a new size in between two sizes here, it\u2019s almost impossible.\nSemantic numbering\n: This refers to scaling with a sequence number, such as \u2013 Display-10, Display-20, Display-30\u2026Display-100, and so on.\nDo read our \nlast post on the Sushi design system\n for more details around the different naming conventions considered during this process.\nTypography system on Figma\nIt\u2019s a good practice to create separate type style libraries for all devices in order to make it easier to access and use.\nKey points to consider while building a typography system\n Make the system extremely flexible. If you decide the number of styles required at the very beginning of the process, and feel you need to include more, or remove some due to redundancy later, you should be able go ahead and make the changes.\nEnsure there is no ambiguity or confusion around the rules of usage. Designers should clearly know which type of style is to be used for which use-case.\nSpend time on building a scalable naming convention. A good naming convention helps make the design-developer handoff faster as it helps developers become aware of all the rules of application. Thus, they would no longer require design support.\nMore than anything, building a good typography system as part of a design system helps save a great amount of time across design and development processes, motivating the teams involved to focus on bigger issues, and opportunities for innovation."

        "content": "\u2018Location\u2019 is one of the most critical aspects that drives customer experience through \u2018Search & Discovery\u2019 and \u2018Online Ordering\u2019 on Zomato. Starting from the different restaurants to be showcased on the app, to delivering orders at the accurate location, it plays a big role in determining how customer-friendly our platform really is.\nA correct location input ensures a seamless delivery experience for both, our customers and our delivery partners. More than anything, it helps our delivery partners navigate with ease, and deliver orders without making multiple phone calls to our customers. This allows them to optimise their time and deliver as many orders as they can.\nTill around a year and a half back, the map views displayed on our app were not as well defined as we would\u2019ve wanted them to be, and instead looked like broadly mapped block visualisations that could lead to ambiguity and marking of incorrect locations.\nIn light of these issues and while solving for a better last-mile handshake experience between our customers and our delivery partners, it occurred to us, why not develop enhancements to the existing mapping system?\u00a0This could be done by building footprints instead of relying on external mapping services.\nHow did we go about enhancing our system?\nWe started by taking on two challenges \u2013\nIdentifying high volume geographical entities (\u2018Points of Interest\u2019). For example, \nOffices\n, \nColleges\n, \nApartments\n, \nHospitals\n, etc.\nMapping these geographical entities\nMapping actual \nbuildings\n / \nsocieties \n/ \noffices\n is a complex task; especially when the GPS accuracy relies a lot on the devices of our customers.\u00a0\nWe started by evaluating customer addresses as the first step.\u00a0\nOn a daily basis, there are a large number of customer addresses added, which contain details around their latitude and longitude, as well as information around the names of their \nlocalities / societies\n. We tokenized these customer addresses and started ranking words on the basis of the rarity of tokens similar to \nTF-IDF\n. This helped us generate key terms in relation to \nlocalities / societies\n such as \u2018\nvipul\u2019\n, \u2018\nhiranandani\n\u2019, \u2018\nventura\n\u2019, \u2018\nwellington\n\u2019, \netc\n.\u00a0\nStep 2\nManaging the local language diversity was another challenge. We had to iterate and smoothen the model inputs for different cities. For example, the spatial density clustering inputs that worked for Gurgaon or Chandigarh failed to produce results for Mumbai.\u00a0\u00a0\nTo tackle this, we started creating density-based clusters for each of the key terms we had defined in Step 1. Post this, we added smoothening models on these clusters and started seeing areas being defined in a much better manner.\u00a0\nWe created GeoJSONs to map the geographical entities and built a moderation queue. It was also important to add some quality metrics in place to check for any incorrect POI mapping.\u00a0\nOnce the moderation process was complete, the POIs were activated for our customers to view.\u00a0\nAdditionally, we built a feedback loop to track a few UX metrics. We released these POIs in A/B mode and utilised the metrics to compare and correct any wrongly mapped POIs, which were live at that point.\nStep 3\nTo take a step further and make POIs even more helpful, we attributed whether a particular POI entity was an \noffice\n, \nhome\n, \ncollege campus\n or a \nhospital\n. This allowed us to create dynamic address forms, which helped us share information with our delivery partners in a more structured format. \nWhat was the impact?\n1. Better accuracy\nSince our customers can now view building footprints on their map, it helps them correct any GPS inaccuracies on their own devices even during a low signal in the area.\u00a0\nWith high to medium range devices, we get an average GPS accuracy of 60m to 150m. However, these can be of up to 2-3km as well, depending on the signal and device.\u00a0\n2. Fewer partner-to-customer calls and shorter handshake time\nWith more accurate delivery locations (lat/lng) and with structured addresses in place, the delivery partner doesn\u2019t have to call and confirm the lane, tower, or floor with the customer. This also results in faster deliveries (which is especially helpful during peak times).\u00a0\n3. Better dining recommendations\nPOIs also helped us drive better \nGo Out\n recommendations. For example, if a customer is within an office complex, it\u2019s better to showcase restaurants within that complex on priority, rather than those outside of it or across the street.\u00a0\nNext steps?\n1. Scaling from 1-to-N\nIn order to scale the POIs, we have started identifying areas with high density addresses and have began generating POIs focused on those specific areas.\n2. Order clubbing\nWe are working on experimenting with POIs to drive POI-based order clubbing.\n3. Leveraging learnings\nWe are learning more about the average handshake times for different POIs (for example, a college or an office might take more time to deliver than a small housing society); and are utilizing these learnings to drive additional use-cases with the sole objective of improving customer experience.\u00a0\u00a0\nTeam\n: \nSumanshu Dwivedi\n, \nAayush Gupta\n, \nYash Gupta\n, \nGaurang Sawhney\n, \nManas Kaushik\n, \nMithran Natarajan\n, \nGeetika Garg\n, \nSushant Jain\nWith contributions from Aayush Gupta and Vaibhav Gupta (ex-Zoman)"

        "content": "On the Zomato app, customers always had the option to skip cutlery with their order. However, very few customers used that option. We learnt that it wasn\u2019t because they always wanted the cutlery, but because they weren\u2019t making an active choice. Defaults almost never get changed by customers during product flows.\u00a0\nWe surveyed thousands of our customers, and a whopping 90%+ of them said that they didn\u2019t really need plastic cutlery with their orders. Keeping this in mind, we decided to change the default mode for cutlery \u2013 \ncustomers will now have to explicitly request for cutlery, tissues, and straws\n, if they need it. This is now a \u2018opt-in\u2019 instead of a \u2018opt-out\u2019.\u00a0\nWe all know that plastic is bad for the environment. But did you know that a single plastic spoon can take 200-500 years to decompose? Millions of such plastic spoons get consumed every day, and we all contribute to it. This seemingly small change on the Zomato app will help save up to 5,000 kilos of plastic in one day \u2013 that is up to 2 million kilos of plastic in a year.\u00a0\nThis is another small step towards cutting down the carbon and environmental footprint of our food delivery business.\nThis change will also help our restaurant partners save \u20b92-5 (~0.5-1% of order value) on every order going forward. We urge all our restaurant partners to start channeling these cost savings to kickstart the transition towards non plastic packaging.\nOur restaurant partners are excited about this change, we do expect some teething issues as we switch to a new default mode. We do not expect 100% compliance from the restaurant-end at the onset. Muscle memory needs to change, and we hope that it will happen over the next few months. We also urge other food aggregators to make this change so that the restaurant industry doesn\u2019t have to shard its muscle memory going forward.\nWe will depend on our customers to drive compliance here. If a restaurant sends you cutlery when they weren\u2019t supposed to, or doesn\u2019t send cutlery when you had asked for it, please share feedback via the post delivery prompt \n(asking \u2018did the restaurant send you cutlery?\u2019)\n on the app. We will pass on the feedback to our restaurant partners to ensure greater adherence.\u00a0\nIf you can, please say no to cutlery and help all of us take another small step towards building a environmentally conscious India.\nUntil next time.\u00a0\nPS \u2013 this feature has already been rolled out to 50% of our customers. This will be rolled out to all customers over the next 3-4 weeks."

        "author": "Vijay Verma",
        "content": "We \nintroduced Sushi\n, Zomato\u2019s in-house design system, to the world in 2019. Since then, the positive reactions we\u2019ve received from the design community have been nothing short of amazing. Moreover, the feedback and learnings we\u2019ve garnered from the products built over the past couple of years have been extremely fruitful, and have helped us evolve Sushi beyond what we had initially envisioned for our design system.\nWe also know that building a design system for one\u2019s own organisation can turn out to be a very exhilarating process. If you are attempting to build one, feel free to try some of the steps we followed at Zomato to get as close to the system as we had imagined to create. \nWe hoped to build a system that would not only support consistency across our products, but would ensure better onboarding, and design collaboration between teams.\nLet\u2019s take a deeper look at how we built and scaled Sushi. \nThe problem\nAs we grow, we adapt to the dynamic customer requirements by constantly modifying or adding new features to our products.\u00a0\nTo keep pace with such a process, we felt the need to build a library that could be referred to for reusable elements, as opposed to creating novel ones every time we decided to enhance an existing product, or develop a new one.\nProblems that our initial approach caused \u2013\nCustomer confusion \u2013 \nDifferent patterns or components responsible for the same action confuse customers.\nSlow design and development process \u2013 \nLack of reusable design assets slow down designers and developers as the elements are then required to be created from scratch.\nOnboarding difficulties \u2013 \nThe onboarding of new designers and developers is a tedious process, and does in fact become more time consuming with an elaborate training.\nThe big question was\nHow can we ensure an all-encompassing positive experience for customers, designers, product managers, and developers?\u00a0\nThe solution was\nTo build a design system that helps release and test new features better, and increasingly faster.\u00a0\nTo accomplish this, we followed these steps \u2013\u00a0\nAuditing the UI inventory\u00a0\nFormulating the design system foundation\nCreating component libraries\nGoverning the system\nBuilding support for all platforms\u00a0\nMapping workflows and onboarding\u00a0\n1. Auditing the UI inventory\nInstead of starting from scratch, we took a deeper look at what we had created in the past. We had a collection of unlabelled components such as typography, colors, layouts, sizes, etc. This gave us something to start with.\u00a0\nCompiling these components made it easy for us to monitor overlaps, or in other words, repeated application of patterns. Additionally, we spotted components that had been used only once, and therefore didn\u2019t have to be accommodated in our style guide.\u00a0\n1.1 Kickstarting the audit\nBrad Frost\n (author of \nAtomic Design\n) suggests that the process to build the inventory should start by consolidating screenshots of the product interface, and then categorising them into chunks. Here\u2019s how we achieved this \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\n2. Formulating the design system\nPost the UI audit, we had a basic style guide ready with colours, typography, icons, spacing, shadows, information architecture, etc. These helped us create unified and reusable components that formed the foundations of our design system.\u00a0\u00a0\nRead more about how we came up with our design system\u2019s foundations in our \nprevious post\n.\u00a0\n2.1 Naming conventions\nA fundamental part of any design system is how we name our styles\n \nand components.\u00a0\nWithout a proper naming convention, designers, product managers and developers, struggle with the effective labelling of different components. Our primary goal was to seek a scalable naming convention that not only had room for known elements, but also took into account future additions.\u00a0\nSolution 1\nThis approach included the usage of generic names in a more abstract format, such as \nxsmall, small, medium, large\n for typography or\n lighter, light\n, \ndarker\n for colour. Even though this was easy to recognize, but was not scalable after a certain point.\nSolution 2\nHere, we added incremental numbers to names, such as \nRed1\n, \nRed2\n, \nRed3\n and so on.\u00a0\nThough this was better than our first solution, it turned out to be complex when we added values between two adjacent places.\u00a0\nFor example, if we wanted to inject a new tint of Red between 1 and 2, which would technically be 1.5 (or anything else in between), it became harder to handle or maintain.\u00a0\nSolution 3\nThis approach allowed us to easily inject values between two adjacent places, as we kept a considerable amount of gap between two values. For example, between 10 and 20, we had room for nine different tints to be injected.\u00a0\nSolution 4 (we are using this)\nThis approach was similar, but better than solution 3 as it gave us more room to scale our values with gaps of 100 available between two adjacent places. \n2.2 Colours\nColours are one of the most important building blocks of any interface. Thus, it was imperative for us to clearly define all the colour tints in our design system.\nDuring the UI audit of our existing components, we were rather shocked to discover that we had \nover 20 tints of grey\n!\u00a0\nWhile we\u2019re aware that one should have various colour tints in their product, it\u2019s not a good practice to exploit that freedom by utilising just any colour for different use cases.\nBrand guidelines always have primary colours, such as \nRed, Blue or Black. \nHowever, UI design requires multiple tints, and tints of each colour to effectively apply them.\nThis also raises the question \u2013 how many tints should ideally suffice here?\n\u00a0\nHere are some key actions we took while creating our colour system \u2013\u00a0\nScaled our colour names between 100 and 1000\n, \nsuch as Red 100 and Red 900, in order to inject new colour tints in between. Tint 500 was used as the base colour everywhere.\nGenerated colours based on HSL to ensure a harmonious colour palette\nValidated colours with \nWCAG 2.0 rules\n in order to maintain contrast and accessibility\nBucketed all colours into primary and secondary groups. Each colour had 10 tints, which were generated with the help of HSL colour conversion.\n2.3 Typography\nTypography is another very important aspect of design systems. How we utilise font families, size and weights in our design depends heavily on typography.\n\u00a0\nEvery font family has a specific design intent and communicates certain attributes. There are many fonts out there and all fall into four basic font categories \u2013 \nserif\n, \nsans serif\n, \nscript\n and \ndisplay/decorative\n. And choosing the right font for a design is very important.\nFor Sushi, we decided to use \nMetropolis \n\u2013 An open-source geometric typeface. We modified it according to our system\u2019s requirements and named it \nOkra.\u00a0\nHere are some key actions we took to create our typography system \u2013\u00a0\nFollowed the same scalable naming convention as we did for \ncolours \nin order to easily scale our typography names between 100 and 1000\nLine height, letter spacing, and font weight were well defined, and HIG or Web standard guidelines were followed\nResponsiveness was a key factor in formulating our typography system. For example, font size 13px on Mobile was mapped to 16px on Web\nHere\n is a great article on Typography by Tim Brown (CEO of the design firm \u2018Ideo\u2019).\u00a0\n2.4 Icons\nIcons are of prime importance because customers can be immensely motivated to perform an action by simply looking at an icon.\u00a0\nFor a long time, we had been using different icon font files for iOS, Android, and Web. We were updating more than 500 icons separately on all platforms. However, the ideal way was to go ahead with a single set of unified icons to serve all platforms.\u00a0\nSo, what did we do?\u00a0\nWe audited all icons and removed the unused ones\nWe created a new repository called \nWasabi\n, and it goes extremely well with Sushi \ud83d\ude42 \nNow, we have a single file serving all platforms including iOS, Android and Web. All our icons are curated using Adobe illustrator and Figma, and the svg icons are then converted into font file using \nFontello\n.\n2.5 Spaces\nSpaces are needed everywhere when it comes to design, specifically in the form of padding and margins.\nSpacing not only helps create new components, but also assists in arranging combinations of existing components. These settings are defined as variables.\nSpacing values are usually factors or multiples of the baseline grid number, and an 8-point baseline can work well for all kinds of platforms. So, our spacing values were decided based on this pattern \u2013 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 30, 32, 36, and so on.\nWhile building Sushi, ~6 to 8 values seemed to offer enough variance and were sufficient for a complex product as well, but one can always add more intervals if they feel the need to.\nOur spacing values were finally fixed at \u2013 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32.\nBy streamlining spacing values, the designer-developer handoffs became faster, and developers were able to effectively predict spacing in mocks shared by designers.\n3. Creating component libraries\nComponents help designers work in a consistent way, and are used repeatedly throughout the development of a product.\nHow do they help?\nEasy usage \n\u2013 Component libraries have ready-to-use components that can be utilised throughout the journey of a product\nFast development \n\u2013 Since these are easy to use for developers, they ensure an increased delivery speed\nEfficient collaboration\n \u2013 Anyone can pick up components from the component library and create their own solutions\nConsistency\n \u2013 Since all stakeholders are referring to the same libraries and are using the same components, the usage remains consistent throughout\nCustomization and flexibility \n\u2013 Most of them follow a certain business logic that is integrated within them, and are open to adhering to new ones\n3.1 How to create, contribute and add new components\nThough we have a large set of components available in our repository called the \nlibrary\n, sometimes the solutions to certain problems require us to design new patterns in our products.\u00a0\nWe analyse all new features and components for every such request we receive by asking the following questions \u2013\nIs this a new component or just a modification of an existing one?\nWhy don\u2019t the current patterns support this use-case?\nHow can we use this component beyond our current scope?\nTo build a new pattern, our designers create components with the help of foundation elements and existing low-level components from the design system. Post this, our developers start building, testing, and releasing these components with proper documentation. Meanwhile, a Figma change log is also created to update the component library.\nInstead of fighting new additions, rig your system to tolerate a bit of experimentation. Then make it easy to incorporate the experiments that work.\n4. Governing the system\nThe design system helps us create a better design culture where everyone can contribute to its continued development. This results in building inclusive customer experiences, as well as in achieving business goals faster.\u00a0\nWe must govern our design system. We need to ensure that the highest standards of quality and accessibility empower our designers.\nAt Zomato, a design development platform team helps us build, govern and manage this system with a goal to design and build faster, keeping consistency in mind.\n5. Building support for all platforms\niOS, Android and Web platforms have their own specific requirements. The design system must have rich components in place to fulfil the requirements of these platforms.\nInitially, we started to build our design system solely for mobile platforms, but later moved to Web as well. We used Figma to create responsive components that can easily scale up and down depending on the screen size.\u00a0\nEvery designed component of Sushi is developed and managed by our platform team in native tech frameworks. We built our Web components in React, which is quite popular with design systems these days.\n6. Mapping workflows and onboarding\nMost of the work involved in building Sushi helped bring people together, along with shipping products faster, and more effectively. It also reduced the amount of time it took for new members to get trained and adapt to the processes we follow internally. Now \u2013\u00a0\nProduct managers \ncan create a pixel-perfect interface with reduced effort\nDesign team\n \nmembers\n can collaborate and design with the latest design components\u00a0\nDevelopers\n can conduct rapid prototyping with clickable prototypes\nBuilding a design system is an endless job, rather it\u2019s just the beginning of a job. The ecosystem gets optimized version by version as we continue to ship new products and features.\u00a0\nCurrently, we are utilising v3 of Sushi that offers a larger library of components, and higher flexibility to apply those as per our requirements.\nHere\u2019s what we are yet to do \u2013\u00a0\nTransfer all remaining products to the Sushi design system\nIntegrate remaining interface elements that are still in the ideation phase\nEnsure that visible interface elements can be localized for multiple regions\nUpdate components for new upcoming feature releases\nMore updates on Sushi coming soon, stay tuned!"

        "author": "Ram Singla",
        "content": "The data lake has been set up, app events are pouring in 24\u00d77, a business problem has been identified, features have been engineered, and a model has been trained, but the road to production looks distant, broken and hard. Does this ring a bell?\u00a0\nYour \u2018Machine Learning (ML) Runtime\u2019 is an overweight beast and you need to get it in shape if you want to scale ML at your organization.\nIf you look at any successful consumer product, they all have one thing in common \u2013 they understand customer preferences in a fraction of a second and personalize the experience for them. This personalization requires surfing through the data lake, creating useful ML models, and then deploying to use these models in production.\u00a0\nAt Zomato, we use ML to predict a lot of unknowns, often in real-time \u2013\u00a0\nWhen will this food order get delivered?\nHow much time will the restaurant take to prepare this food order?\nWho should be the delivery partner (DP) for this food order?\nIs this photo a food shot?\nIs the DP properly groomed?\nIs the DP wearing a mask?\nIs this review a fake review?\nSolving these unknowns help us provide better customer experience and improve business metrics by either reducing costs, or increasing the revenue. I strongly believe, if an organisation starts integrating ML in their daily operating activities, it can create significant differentiation in the product experience.\nThe three ingredients of ML\nAt the heart of ML is a simple equation of three variables \u2013 \nInput, Brain and Output.\nIf the \nOutput\n and the \nInput\n are known, the process of figuring out the \nBrain\n is called \nModel Training\n. And if the \nInput\n and the \nBrain\n are known, the process of computing the \nOutput\n is called \nModel Prediction\n.\nWhen we deploy a model to production, we create a \u2018Model Server\u2019 so that we can make predictions via remote API\u2019s (Application Program Interface). By using these remote API\u2019s, we can make Model Predictions and make our applications smart. As you deploy more \u2018Model Servers\u2019, you evolve your \u2018ML Runtime\u2019. Formalizing your model training and deployment process can increase your team\u2019s cadence, and higher cadence means faster turnaround time, more experimentation, and better models.\nEngineering the system that performs at scale and still predicts at a fraction of a second requires a well-oiled \u2018ML Runtime\u2019. And our \u2018ML Runtime\u2019 consists of four essential components \u2013 Feature Compute Engine, Feature Store, Model Store, and Model Serving API Gateway.\nWe support two types of features based on frequency \u2013 real-time features and batched features. Real-time features are computed via event streams published on Apache Kafka, and are processed in real-time by stream processing engine Apache Flink. These are then stored in an \nOnline Feature Store\n powered by Redis Cluster. Batched features are computed using Apache Spark, and are stored in our \nOffline Feature Store\n DynamoDB with hot features getting cached in Redis Cluster.\nLoad testing \u2018Feature Store\u2019\nIn preparation for 2021 New Year\u2019s Eve, we load-tested our Feature Store to a maximum throughput of around 18 million requests per minute, with everything working as expected in terms of performance and latency. This led to a \n3X improvement\n in our Feature Store service compared to 2020 New Year\u2019s Eve.\nHere at Zomato, we convert all our production models into a standard format via MLFlow, which also provides a registry for such models. The primary advantage of doing so is decoupling. It makes it possible to write tools that work with models from any ML library \n(Tensorflow, PyTorch, LightGBM or scikit-learn)\n without having to integrate each tool with each library.\u00a0\nComing to our production deployment, it is orchestrated in the cloud with Kubernetes, which is a container orchestration platform. Most of the models we use are tuned for inferencing on CPU rather than GPU, and to further optimize the cost, we utilise spot instances in our Kubernetes cluster. This setup of ML on Kubernetes has helped us adapt and scale the model, serving across multiple production models, with ease.\nInterestingly, after deploying multiple models in production, we observed a pattern \u2013 model features are tightly coupled with the production model. As a system-design, to make our model changes faster and more independent, the desired outcome is to engineer a system that makes clients agnostic to this coupling. Our ML API Gateway was written in Golang with the intent to remove this coupling at the client side so that the specific logic sits within the Gateway.\nGenerally, when we redeploy a retrained model or a new model to the same problem, our API requests to the ML API Gateway do not change. That gives us tremendous liberty to deploy and experiment models often, and with less effort. ML API Gateway has been written as a workflow engine that executes a directed acyclic graph of tasks, and it has native support with our Feature Store i.e. the Gateway is responsible for fetching features for the model based on the request from the Feature Store as specified in the model plan.\u00a0\nThis system has reduced our time to deploy a model to production to less than 24 hours.\nLet\u2019s now review what we have built in the last one year using this \u2018ML Runtime\u2019. All of this has been accomplished by a small team of highly motivated explorers and deeply committed Data Scientists, ML Engineers and Data Engineers at Zomato.\u00a0\n1. Menu digitization\nCustomers have different cravings, and sometimes, very specific ones. Maybe when the mood hits, they don\u2019t want just any kind of Indian food \u2013 they want Chicken Chettinad with a side of paratha, and nothing else will hit the spot! To help such eaters satisfy their cravings, we have built \na system that uses ML to digitize menus\n without the requirement of any human input. This enables us to automatically recommend restaurants to customers based on searches for specific dishes.\u00a0\nWith this system, we have witnessed improvements in customer experience through advanced dish search. Our content team also uses it to accelerate menu creation for online ordering.\nThe system takes a menu image as input and passes it to different models like Text Detection, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Section Detection and Dish Classifier to showcase where different kinds of dishes are presented within the menu.\u00a0\nBy \nChiranjeev Ghai\n2. Personalized homepage restaurant listings\nRestaurant recommendations are powered through a customer\u2019s past purchases, browsing history, and what other similar customer\u2019s in the vicinity are ordering. The aim is to optimize for order through rates (OTR), and to achieve this optimization, we utilize the LambdaMART implementation of LightGBMs called LGBMRanker.\nBy \nSaurabh Kalia\n, \nManav Gupta\n3. Increase in GMV and AOV\u00a0\nOften, we want to solve multiple business objectives simultaneously. The primary goal of restaurant listings is to not only optimize the OTR but also increase GMV per app open. In our case, this translates into recommending restaurants to a customer such that they view more restaurants in line with their interests, and in turn, increase the value and frequency of their orders.\u00a0\nThis multi-objective optimization is achieved by a popular Reinforcement Learning technique known as Contextual Multi-Arm Bandit (MAB) with Bayesian Regression. We used features related to Order Value Distribution for customers and restaurants, and the Probability to Order to optimize for GMV and OTR. This is implemented at customer level, and the weights for each customer are updated daily based on their interaction with our restaurant listing. MAB gives the expected reward at a customer-restaurant level and the restaurants are re-ranked based on the expected reward.\nWe were able to increase GMV per app open and AOV by INR 3 and INR 6 respectively through this approach.\nBy \nDeepankar Pal\n, \nManav Gupta\n4. Predicting food preparation time (FPT)\nFPT is an important component of Estimated Delivery Time (EDT) that we share with customers placing an order on Zomato. A more accurate FPT prediction translates into a more accurate EDT prediction and hence, makes it less likely for us to breach the EDT conveyed to our customers. FPT depends on numerous factors such as the quantity of dishes ordered, type of dishes ordered, restaurant behaviour, time of day, day of week, footfall in the restaurant, etc.\u00a0\nWe have created a Bidirectional LSTM-based deep learning model that takes into account all these features and provides FPT for each order in real-time.\u00a0\nBy \nDeepankar Pal\n, \nAbhilash Awasthi\n5. Enhancing road detection\nZomato\u2019s ETA, time services, and various location-based services rely on map data which is in an open source format. It may be free, but there is ample room for improvement, especially because it is sparse in many Indian cities.\u00a0\nThis specific project tried to leverage extensive DP pings along with DP trip data to reconstruct maps. This helps create new roads, unknown roads, and shortcuts, which in turn result in dense maps, higher ETA accuracy, better snapping, routing, addressing, etc.\u00a0\nThis multi-level approach includes improving raw location data by conducting sensor fusion within the DP app, implementing various pre & post-filtering techniques to remove GPS noise, map inferencing & reconstruction, filtration of new roads, merging the newfound roads with India maps, making them routable, etc.\nBy \nSiddhartha Agnihotri\n, \nVedanta Jha\n6. Active DP dispatch\nOur DP\u2019s often travel to locations, which according to their instincts and experience, drive higher orders for them. As a result of this behaviour, a gap in supply and demand is created, which leads to shutdown due to short supply at specific locations.\u00a0\nActive Dispatch, a Deep Q-Network-based multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Model, aims to reduce this gap and also increase DP utility by recommending appropriate locations to free DP\u2019s. This model is trained using predicted demand and available DP supply to increase their earnings. Empirical testing has shown it to be better performing than a system without any recommendations and rule-based algorithms. Overall, it led to an increase in % orders a DP received when they followed our recommendation, and a decrease in time between delivery and their next order.\u00a0\nBy \nRahul Kumar\n, \nShubh Chaurasia\n7. DP grooming audit and compliance\nAt Zomato, our delivery fleet is one of the most important components of our ecosystem and pivotal to great customer experience. To ensure its proper functioning, we have put various audit mechanisms in place.\nOur \u2018DP selfie audit\u2019 is one such case where we check for compliance related to DP grooming \u2013 asset audit and mask audit. The asset audit checks whether DP\u2019s have put on a Zomato t-shirt and are carrying a Zomato bag, whereas the mask audit checks whether DP\u2019s have put on masks for safe and secure deliveries.\nTo solve this, we have developed a system where we can easily schedule such audits and automatically approve or disapprove of DP grooming. In this system, an audit can be triggered on the DP app either while they\u2019re logging in or during order deliveries. The DP\u2019s are mandated to submit their selfie in a very short span of time, which increases accuracy of checks. These images then flow to our DP-service, which passes them to deep learning models that can effectively detect faces with and without masks. Our asset audit similarly replicates the process for the presence of Zomato t-shirts and assets.\nThese models are trained using convolutional neural network and image processing algorithms in a classification setting. The addition of automated systems to the pre-existing manual moderation (moderated by human moderators) allows us to conduct more frequent audits, and at scale, by removing the cost associated with manual-audits. This also helps provide real-time feedback for a seamless DP experience.\nBy \nSanjeev Dubey\nIf you find these models interesting and want to be a part of the team that builds them on a daily basis, drop a message to our team members (mentioned above), and tell them why you\u2019d be a right fit at Zomato."

        "content": "Last week, we delivered a billion orders on Zomato. It took us 6 years to get to this milestone and we hope it takes us much less time to deliver the next billion. The fact that 10%+ of these billion orders were delivered only in the last three months makes us confident about getting to the next billion much sooner.\nThe last few weeks have been pleasantly overwhelming. We thank you for the incredible response to the Zomato IPO. We also appreciate the confidence you have shown in our execution over the last few years, and are looking forward to continuing working hard at building a greatly loved, meaningfully large business in the years to come.\u00a0\nWe aim to be one of the best guardians of your capital/earnings in the long term. Through letters to shareholders (like this one), we will transparently address all meaningful questions around our business.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s start with the good news \n\u2013 the last quarter (Q1 FY22) went well. \nAdjusted Revenue \ngrew by 26% quarter-over-quarter (\u201cQoQ\u201d) to INR 11.6 billion; year-over-year (\u201cYoY\u201d) growth is irrelevant (and unnaturally high) here since Q1 FY21 was severely impacted by the first wave of lockdowns in 2020.\nRevenue growth was largely on the back of growth in our core food delivery business which continued to grow despite the severe COVID wave starting April. On the other hand, COVID significantly impacted the dining-out business in Q1 FY22 reversing most of the gains the industry made in Q4 FY21.\nQ1 FY22 was also one of the most challenging quarters for our team. As the second COVID wave ravaged the nation, we were left scrambling to work on multiple things at the same time. At the peak of the second wave, almost 35% of our employees were battling COVID in their households. On top of it, we were executing very hard along with Feeding India to source and distribute oxygen concentrators to as many hospitals in need as possible.\nIn hindsight, our team battled against the odds to execute extremely well amidst this challenging environment.\nAdjusted EBITDA\n loss was INR 1.7 billion in Q1 FY22 as compared to INR 1.2 billion in Q4 FY21. The loss for Q1 FY22 reported in our financial statements is INR 3.6 billion as compared to the Adjusted EBITDA loss of INR 1.7 billion. This is largely on account of non-cash ESOP expenses which have increased meaningfully in Q1 FY22 due to significant ESOP grants made in the quarter pursuant to creation of a new ESOP 2021 scheme. \nThis divergence in reported profit/loss and Adjusted EBITDA will continue going forward.\nAdding some more color to the business trajectory \u2013 our India food delivery business continues to remain contribution positive; although the contribution margin reduced slightly in Q1 FY22 as compared to the previous quarter on account of growth investments in addition to the costlier business environment (due to lockdowns) in which this growth was achieved.\u00a0\nIndia dining-out revenue shrunk over the previous quarter which also led to increase in Adjusted EBITDA losses. Hyperpure losses expanded in Q1 FY22 due to investments in growth.\u00a0\nIndia food delivery\n business reported the highest ever GOV, number of orders, transacting users, active restaurant partners and active delivery partners till date in any quarter in our history.\u00a0\nIndia food delivery GOV in Q1 FY22 grew by 37% QoQ to INR 45.4 billion ($605m), from INR 33.1 billion ($442m) in Q4 FY21 (@ 1 USD = 75 INR).\nGross Order Value (\u201cGOV\u201d) is defined as the total monetary value of all food delivery orders placed online on our platform in India including taxes, customer delivery charges, gross of all discounts, excluding tips.\nWe love bad news at Zomato.\n Call us weird, but we get more excited than disappointed when we hear bad news. Bad news is an opportunity to improve. No business can ever be perfect, but every business can always aim to become better than yesterday.\nLast year, we ranked at the bottom of a gig economy worker survey conducted by an independent third party. We acknowledged that there was a lot we needed to do and we fast tracked a number of initiatives in the pipeline to improve the work environment for our delivery partners.\u00a0\nIn order to track our progress on a real time basis, we put together a Delivery Partner NPS Survey in place, through which 76% of our delivery partners engage with us directly. This is statistically significant, unlike 3rd party surveys which are subjective to say the very least.\nOver the last year, here are a few initiatives we made to improve the working conditions of our delivery partner network \u2013\u00a0\nImproved payout structure: \nDuring the course of the year, we have redesigned our payout structure for our delivery partners. We added an additional fee for long distance and increase in fuel prices (among other variables) to ensure delivery partners are fairly compensated. The subsequent increase in their earnings per order is \n~15% higher than what it was about a year ago.\nExtended cash limit:\n We have heavily increased (1.5x-2x, depending on delivery partner\u2019s age and quality on platform) the existing cash limit for our delivery partners, enabling them to utilise cash collected from cash-on-delivery orders for their own spends, thereby improving the available working capital with them for their mid-week spends. This outstanding amount is adjusted against the weekly payout, saving the delivery partners time, trips, and cash-in-hand deficits.\nRemote onboarding, and home delivery of assets:\n We let go of physical onboarding centres for new delivery partners. They can now undergo DIY remote onboarding, training, background verification using our Delivery Partner app, and start working without spending time visiting a physical onboarding centre. New partners also receive their assets (t-shirts and delivery bags) through home delivery in just a few hours after remote onboarding, thus ensuring they start earning much faster.\nBetter communication of insurance benefits:\n While we always had medical, accidental life insurance, and COVID relief programs for our delivery partners, lack of awareness kept them from making use of these benefits. We now have a dedicated section on the delivery partner app that explains all details related to insurance and healthcare benefits. We have also simplified the process of cashless settlement of claims. Since these changes, the number of successful claims have moved up dramatically (2x).\nWe value our delivery partner\u2019s safety\n. We organised nationwide vaccination camps free of cost for our partners; as of today, more than 160,000 of our delivery partners have had at least one jab of COVID-19 vaccine. This number continues to increase as we speak.\nand numerous other little but meaningful things..\nWe believe we pay our delivery partners fairly for the work that they put in.\n We are proud to create hundreds of thousands of gigs for a strata of society which otherwise didn\u2019t have a predictable source of income. On an average, the top 20% of our delivery partners who deliver on bikes and put in more than 40 hours a week receive a payout of more than \u20b927,000 per month. Perhaps, the reason why our delivery partners work with us is because they see higher earnings potential compared to other jobs/gigs available to them at the moment.\nAll of this has ensured a tremendous increase in the NPS scores of our delivery partners, from -10% last year to 28% in the last few months. Our work here is clearly not done and we hope to report back with much better scores over the next few quarters.\nWe had 310k active delivery partners in July, which is the highest ever in our lifetime. As we look ahead, we will continue to focus on making Zomato the platform of choice for all our stakeholders and consistently strive to improve the NPS for our delivery partners, restaurant partners and customers.\u00a0\nLast but not the least, we also remain grateful to our shareholders and investors, who have believed in us and in our long-term view of our business.\u00a0\nStay well,\nDeepinder (Founder & CEO) and Akshant (CFO).\nNOTE \u2013\u00a0We will do earnings/analyst calls once a year, at the end of each fiscal, where we will share a more detailed commentary on the year gone by along with key metrics. In the meanwhile, please feel free to write to us at \nshareholders@zomato.c\nom if you have any questions/clarifications. We will address the most frequent/pertinent ones in our future blogs and/or quarterly shareholder letters.\nThis letter should be read along with the \nfull version\n of this quarter\u2019s financial performance and necessary disclaimers."

India is a tough market to operate in, but if you are building to succeed in India, you are already exceptional. I say that because I believe Zomato and Swiggy are two of the best food delivery apps in the world today. We have a long way to go before we can call ourselves world class by our customers\u2019 standards, but we are determined to get there.\nOur 10+ year journey has not always been smooth. We have lived through many ups and downs \u2013 something not every company has the privilege of living long enough to do. I have made many decisions which have been good for the company, while some have caused our stakeholders a lot of heartburn. That said, we have found ourselves managing times of crisis on different occasions in much the same way \u2013 impatiently staying focused on the long term, executing relentlessly, and committing ourselves to doing the very best we can do today.\u00a0\nEven in our hardest times, we\u2019ve had half of our tech/engineering team work on long-term initiatives. And during the good times, we double down on the long term even harder. The only short term work we do is whatever will earn us the right to continue building the future. We deeply understand that anything good and meaningful takes decades to build.\nWe are going to relentlessly focus on 10 years out and beyond, and are not going to alter our course for short term profits at the cost of long term success of the company. The tremendous response to our IPO gives us the confidence that the world is full of investors who appreciate the magnitude of investments we are making, and take a long term view of our business.\u00a0\nThey say it takes a village to raise a child, and we are no exception. Hundreds of people have selflessly played a part in making Zomato what it is today. While some of them no longer work with us, the influence of Pankaj, Saurabh, Mohit Kumar, Mukund, Akshar, and so many others can still be felt at Zomato. To our investors who have stood by us through thick and thin; Sanjeev, Mohit, Vamsi, Vishesh, Eric \u2013 we thank you for your confidence in us, and we hope to live up to your expectations in the future.\nToday is a big day for us. A new Day Zero. But we couldn\u2019t have gotten here without the incredible efforts of India\u2019s entire internet ecosystem. Jio\u2019s prolific growth has set all of us up for unprecedented scale. Flipkart, Amazon, Ola, Uber, Paytm \u2013 have also over the years, collectively laid the railroads that are enabling companies like ours to build the India of the future. We stand proudly and humbly on the shoulders of giants, and we thank everyone for giving us, and so many other startups, the opportunity to look ahead into the future.\nI don\u2019t know whether we will succeed or fail \u2013 we will surely, like always, give it our best. But I hope that the fact that we are here, inspires millions of Indians to dream bigger than we ever have, and build something way more incredible than what we can dream of.\u00a0\nDeepi"

With the help of your donations, we were able to procure and distribute oxygen concentrators (OCs) to hospitals that were running out of it, and at the same time struggling with the influx of patients. To solve long-term demand, we are also helping set up \nfour oxygen generation plants.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nAround two months ago, we managed to procure a total of \n9,210 oxygen concentrators [6,020 (10Ltrs) + 3,190 (5Ltrs)].\n Average cost per machine at that time was ~\u20b970,000.\u00a0\nWith the help of our on-ground partner Swasth and logistic partner Delhivery, the procured OCs were distributed directly to \u2013\nWe thank you for believing in us. We raised a total of \n~\u20b966 crores\n for our endeavour. 100% of these donations were utilised for purchasing and distributing OCs. Feeding India does not keep any \u2018admin fee\u2019.\nWe are very grateful to you\n for giving us an opportunity to represent you and save countless lives. Going forward, with your support, we wish to remain true to our ethos of \u201cbe the first to act\u201d for anything that our country will need us for. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\nDeepinder Goyal\nFounder & CEO, Zomato"

To begin with, we have set ourselves\n a goal of reaching 10% participation by the end of 2021 \nstarting with Bangalore, Mumbai, and Pune.\nAdding more women to our delivery fleet is not as simple as just targeting more women for this job. That\u2019s because our policies need to change in order to attract and retain more women delivery partners. To achieve our goal of 10% women participation in the three pilot cities, we are working on four key initiatives \u2013\u00a0\nAccess to safety-related education and tools\u00a0\nWe are adding self-defense training to our onboarding process which will be mandatory for all women delivery partners to attend\u00a0\nIn addition to our first-aid kits, all women delivery partners will be equipped with a handy hygiene and safety kit\nContactless deliveries by default\nTo prioritize our women delivery partners\u2019 safety, we will be making late evening deliveries contactless by default\nExtended support from our restaurant partners\nMany restaurant partners have come forward to ensure access to basic facilities such as separate washrooms for our women partners\nWe will highlight these restaurants with a #GirlPower tag (tag subject to change) on our app to showcase their support towards an equitable society\nFurthermore, our women partners will be able to rate restaurants on \u201cease and safety\u201d. We will utilize these ratings to improve working conditions for all our delivery partners.\u00a0\nSOS button and dedicated support\nWe are setting up a 24\u00d77 helpline \u2013 a dedicated support team for our women partners \u2013 which will focus on expediting emergency requests to prioritize safety\nOnce triggered, the SOS button, on our delivery partner app, will automatically share live location with our on-ground teams, central rider support, and other delivery partners in the vicinity\nHopefully, in the near future, people won\u2019t generalise this community as \ndelivery boys\n, and see them for what they truly are \u2013 \ndelivery partners.\u00a0\nWe continue to take feedback from our delivery partners and work towards making necessary changes \u2013 big or small, whatever may be the need of the hour to make Zomato a more inclusive workplace.

We believe key barriers that currently impact adoption include limited battery range, lack of charging infrastructure, higher upfront costs and lack of trust in new technology.\u00a0\nHowever, given the rapid innovation in this field and positive push by the government, we expect a much faster transition to EVs for the two wheeler industry over time.\u00a0\nWe want to actively aid the transition to EVs by enabling the ecosystem \u2013 EV players, battery manufacturers, and the government.

But that does not mean that everything else that needs to change in the world takes a backseat.\nAt Zomato we\u2019ve been working on multiple fronts to strengthen our own long-standing commitment to making our company more inclusive and diverse for years. Be it through initiatives such as an equal parental leave policy for \u2013 men, women, same-sex, surrogate or adoptive parents; or period/menstruation leaves. Or just leveling the playing field for younger professionals from diverse educational backgrounds, to have a seat at the tables that matter the most in the organisation.\nAnd up until now, we had a largely investor run board. But today, I\u2019m elated to share that we have \nfive\n independent members on our board of \neight\n people, \nfour\n of whom are women.\nMore than gender diversity though, what we have always been gunning for is cognitive diversity across levels in our organisation. Evidence based research shows that a key prerequisite for innovation comes from cognitively diverse people.\nOn that note, having gender diversity on our board was a baseline, not a north star. Today, it makes me truly happy to share that each of our board members come from different occupational backgrounds bringing diverse cognitive skills and perspectives to the table.\nA number of companies start with a diverse employee base at the entry-level, but it reduces significantly over time, and at senior levels. We decided to turn the paradigm on its head by introducing diversity with our Board of Directors. We\u2019re hoping this is another small step towards building a truly lasting organizational culture where everybody belongs. And everybody thrives.\n\u2014\nThanks Sutapa for pushing me, and helping me write this post."

As of today, we are at ~110% of pre-covid GMV run rate in our food delivery business.\nWHO has said that food delivery is safe and people should not fear food packaging. We have delivered over 13 crore orders since the first lockdown started in March, and there have been zero reported cases of covid transmission through food or its packaging.\u00a0\nWhile the above signs have been more than encouraging, we know that: a) this growth has not been uniform, and b) the overall food service industry is still far from full recovery. The sector will continue to need all the help to get back to pre-covid levels.\u00a0\nBasis these insights, we have been focusing on finding more ways to safely serve our customers while responsibly helping our restaurant partners grow. One common solution that checked all the right boxes was the option for customers to pick up their own orders.\u00a0\nThis addresses multiple issues:\nThere are still millions of customers who haven\u2019t yet ordered since the beginning of the lockdown. We believe a lot of them who are bored with home-cooked food will start consuming restaurant food with a safe and convenient takeaway option\u00a0\nFor restaurants that already serve delivery orders, takeaway provides another avenue to access more customers, and further grow their business\nInfact, takeaway on our app has witnessed tremendous growth with the order volume increasing by more than 200% in the last few months.\n\u00a0\nTherefore, \nfor restaurants to be able to tap\n into this demand immediately, we are making our takeaway service available for free to our restaurant partners.\u00a0 We will not be charging any commission, and will also forego the payment gateway charges we incur on all takeaway orders\n.\u00a0\nWe are already live with 55,000+ restaurants on takeaway across the country and are serving tens of thousands of such orders weekly. This is another step we are taking towards helping the restaurant ecosystem get back on its feet quickly.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s how our customers can switch to the takeaway option on the restaurant menu page on zomato \u2013\u00a0\nCustomers can also search for all restaurants offering takeaway using relevant filters on our home page \u2013\u00a0\nSafety remains a top priority for us. We continue to work with our restaurant partners so that they follow all safety measures and encourage our customers to wear masks and practice social distancing when they pick up their orders.\nFor our restaurant partners interested in signing up for this service, please contact your account manager, or write to us at \no2help@zomato.com"

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/mid-covid-report-2/",
        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "Since we published our first mid-COVID Report on August 19th, the food delivery industry has shown stronger signs of recovery. It continues to grow back steadily to pre-COVID levels, with the overall sector clocking ~85%+ of pre-COVID GMV (Gross Merchandise Value), up from ~75%+ last month.\nThis mid-COVID Report focuses on food delivery sector recovery with a regional flavour. The key insight in today\u2019s report is that the \nfood delivery sector has recovered to (and even grown beyond) pre-COVID levels\n \nin a number of large pockets of the country, led by some of the most affluent residential areas in the country\n.\n1. Delhi and Mumbai are nearing full recovery (95% of pre-COVID), metros such as Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Chennai are still behind the curve (~80% of pre-COVID). Some cities such as Kolkata, Patna, Jamshedpur, Ranchi, and Siliguri have recovered completely and have exceeded pre-COVID levels.\n2. Within most cities, the affluent parts of the city are driving this recovery. Here\u2019s how Delhi\u2019s recovery looks like\u2026\n3. With more premium restaurants, i.e. restaurants where a meal for two may cost \u20b91500 and above, now opening up to online delivery, a larger number of affluent consumers are embracing online ordering. Overall spends on such premium restaurants have grown by over 25% over pre-COVID levels.\n4. Customers are now relying on food delivery even more than usual when a city goes under a lockdown. Some cities such as Kolkata see more customers ordering online when the city is (more or less) shut, but restaurants are open.\n5. With lockdown restrictions, celebrations have moved back home. Festivals and occasions such as Raksha Bandhan, Janmashtami, Teacher\u2019s Day, and Independence Day saw a massive spike in orders. Customers, who had not ordered since the first day of lockdown, are 20% more likely to order for the first time during such festivals and occasions.\n6. As customers spend more time with their families, group ordering has become more relevant than ever. Order sizes, i.e. items per order, have increased by 20% over pre-COVID levels. Recovery on single person meals, which constituted nearly ~60% of all orders pre-COVID, lingers at 50-70% level for most regions. On the other hand, orders with meals for 3 or more persons have recovered well and are higher than even pre-COVID levels currently.\nWith the ongoing IPL season and the subsequent festival season, we expect food delivery in both metros and smaller cities to make a full recovery soon \u2013 and resume growing over pre-COVID levels."

In all, we distributed 7.8 cr+ meals across 181 cities.\nWe believe in utmost transparency and accountability and have partnered with Grant Thornton to independently review the impact we created, our processes and system controls around each pillar of this initiative that we launched in March.\nDetailed report: \nhttps://bit.ly/3h6u3Sf\nIn early April, when all of us were getting used to working from home, India\u2019s daily wager community was struggling to find ways to feed their families. The loss of daily livelihood meant that they had no money to pay their landlords, and no money to put food on the table. COVID-19 was the least of their worries.\n50 Zomato employees, 500+ Feeding India volunteers (aka Hunger Heroes), 99,883 individuals, 66 companies and 426 NGOs came together with Feeding India in a massive collaborative effort to ensure that millions of our fellow countrymen do not sleep on an empty stomach. \nWe are thankful to each of our partners for being the nicest people to work with.

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "Click here to download this report in PDF\n.\nThe pandemic has had a massive effect on the restaurant industry. Over the last few days, we reached out to thousands of restaurants and customers across various cities in India to understand the current state and future outlook of the industry. In this report, we will present our findings for the two key components of the restaurant industry \u2013 delivery, and dining out. \nIndia Food Delivery\nHIGHLIGHT\nThe food delivery industry has largely recovered, with the overall sector clocking around 75-80% of pre-COVID GMV. \nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n1. Some areas in some cities are clocking higher GMV than before (affluent neighbourhoods no longer fear contagion from food delivery, and are combining home entertainment with outside food). Predictably, residential areas are doing 50% better than commercial areas. Restaurants in and around commercial districts are expected to take the longest to recover.\n2. Zomato has delivered 7 crore food orders since lockdown started on March 25th. We estimate that between other food aggregators and direct restaurant channels, Indians have ordered 20 crore times since the lockdown. There have been \nzero reported cases\n of COVID transmission due to food delivery. \n3. Sporadic lockdowns in some cities disrupt business as usual for a few days. However, food delivery volumes bounce back as soon as these lockdowns are lifted.\n4. The number of restaurants offering food delivery are at 70% of pre-COVID levels. Out of this, about 5% restaurants did not offer food delivery services pre-COVID. Most of these are dining out centric places which have shown agility to pivot to food delivery.\u00a0\n5. With companies giving employees the option to work from home, there has been a mass exodus of people from metros to other cities across India \u2013 1 in every 5 Zomato customers in metros (pre-COVID) have opened their app from a smaller town recently. Out of these relocated folks, one third have already started ordering food again from their new location.\n6. Interestingly, ordering frequency of customers after their first order mid-COVID is the same as pre-COVID, which shows that the first order mid-COVID is key for customers to cross the hump of safety perception.\n7. Recovery trends are strong and we estimate the industry to hit pre-COVID levels of business in the next 2-3 months.\nIndia Dining Out\nHIGHLIGHT\nDining out industry in India is yet to bounce back and operating at 8-10% of pre-COVID levels. Slump in the industry is largely driven by markets being in lockdown, consumers not stepping out due to fear of transmission and restaurants not opening up, even if the city is not in lockdown.\u00a0\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n1. Even in cities where restrictions have been lifted, only 17% dining out restaurants are open for business at the moment which are also running at low capacity.\n2. Out of the 83% restaurants that are not open for business, 10% restaurants have already shut down permanently and we anticipate an additional 30% restaurants to not reopen at all. Remaining 43% are closed right now but likely to open, as the situation becomes better.\u00a0\n3. Most of the customers plan to decrease spending on dining out in the near future and some of this spend will shift to food delivery. 60% restaurateurs said they estimate to retain less than half of their original business volumes for a few months even post-COVID. \n4. Safety and hygiene have now become a permanent addition to the customer\u2019s decision making model. In markets with low COVID incidence (e.g. New Zealand), safety and hygiene still figure as one of the top factors but usual factors like price and location have already started commanding a higher significance in a consumer\u2019s decision making process compared to two months ago.\n5. Strong recovery in international markets paints an optimistic picture \u2013 Zomato\u2019s dining out transactions in markets like New Zealand, UAE and Portugal are already back to pre-COVID levels. However, recovery in India will be slow and would largely be driven by industry\u2019s ability to build back consumer confidence.\nDespite the tough macro environment, it is heartening to see restaurants reimagining their operations rapidly to accommodate new social engagement constructs. When we step into restaurants now, we are bound to notice changes (staff wearing masks, tables arranged at a distance, digital menus, ordering & payment), that were not part of the restaurant dining experience six months ago.\u00a0\nWe thank all our restaurant partners and customers for their candid participation in this study. We hope this gives restaurant owners some useful data and points of view to plan for the future of their businesses."

Starting today, all women (including transgender people) at Zomato can avail up to 10 days of period leaves in a year.\nWhy 10? Most women have ~14 menstrual cycles in a year. Adjusting for the probability of you having your periods on a weekend, you can now rightfully avail 10 extra leaves compared to men\nYou can only take one period leave for each menstrual cycle\nZomato understands that men and women are born with different biological realities. It is our job to make sure that we make room for our biological needs, while not lowering the bar for the quality of our work and the impact that we create\nThere shouldn\u2019t be any shame or stigma attached to applying for a period leave. You should feel free to tell people on internal groups, or emails that you are on your period leave for the day\nIn case you face any unnecessary harassment, or distasteful comments from men or women about the fact that you applied for a period leave, or that you are vocal about it, please report them to \nspeakup@zomato.com\n \u2013 our prevention of sexual harassment (POSH) team will quickly spring into action\nWhile we are introducing this leave to build a more inclusive work culture, a word of necessary advice \u2013\u00a0\nThese leaves should only be availed if you are \nreally\n unable to attend to work\u00a0\nIf you do need to take the day off, please apply for the leave on the HR portal, communicate to your team that you will be unavailable, reschedule your meetings and proactively communicate if deadlines are getting impacted\nDo not abuse these leaves or use them as a crutch to take time out for other pending tasks\u00a0\nTake care of yourself \u2013 regular focus on fitness and diet has a positive impact on every bit of your physical and mental health\nA note for men\n \u2013 our female colleagues expressing that they are on their period leave shouldn\u2019t be uncomfortable for us. This is a part of life, and while we don\u2019t fully understand what women go through, we need to trust them when they say they need to rest this out. I know that menstrual cramps are very painful for a lot of women \u2013 and we have to support them through it if we want to build a truly collaborative culture at Zomato.\nStay calm, and strong.\nDeepinder"

        "content": "Click here to download this report in PDF.\n \nHello world.\nWe have been publishing our annual report in the first week of April for the last three years. Typically, our annual reports outline our performance during the last year, and some narrative on what we think the future holds in store for us. This year, when the pandemic hit the world, our past became irrelevant, and the future uncertain. We decided to delay our annual report by a few months (some perks of being a private company).\nRight now, in the middle of July, as our future seems more predictable, we decided to publish this performance report for the last five quarters combined. \nThis performance report consists of three parts \u2013\n 1 \u2013 Financial performance (FY19 vs FY20, Q1 FY21)\n 2 \u2013 Business segment performance (2a \u2013 India Food Delivery, 2b \u2013 Dining Out, 2c \u2013 B2B Supplies)\n 3 \u2013 Social Responsibility (Feeding Foundation)\n1 \u2013 Financials (FY19 vs FY20, Q1 FY21)\nOur revenue in FY20 grew by 105% as compared to FY19 while the costs grew by only 47% in the corresponding period. Moving our business towards profitability was a core focus for us in FY20 and we made significant progress along that journey.\nIn the last few quarters, as is evident from the charts above, we fast tracked our efforts towards making our business profitable and drive efficiency into our spends. While COVID-19 has impacted the size of our business, it has accelerated our journey to profitability. In terms of the size of the business, COVID-19 has set us back by a year or so \u2013 but a year is only a small blip when you are building a company for the next 100 years. \nHaving said that, COVID-19 has positively impacted the health of our business \u2013 we seem to have gained 2-3 years along this vector. In July 2020, we estimate our monthly burn rate to land under $1m, while our revenue should land at ~60% of pre-COVID peaks ($23m per month). We expect to make a complete recovery in the coming 3-6 months while continuing to maintain tight control on costs/profitability. \nNow, let\u2019s dive deep into our three business segments \u2013\n2a \u2013 India Food Delivery\nFY20 was a defining year for food delivery in India. While FY19 saw hyper-competition between four well-funded food delivery players, FY20 ended with a two player market structure. Zomato\u2019s FY20 India Food Delivery GMV grew by 108% over FY19.\nWe acquired Uber Eats India business in January 2020 which helped propel us to market leadership in this hotly contested space. The transition of users and merchants from Uber Eats India to Zomato was swift, and so well coordinated by both the teams that we were able to transfer and retain 97% of the combined GMV on the Zomato app.\nRight after the rise of COVID-19 cases in India towards the end of March, our food delivery GMV hit its lowest point in two years \u2013 GMV was 80% down in the last week of March 2020, compared to our peak pre-COVID-19 week (in mid February).\nAs of now, our food delivery GMV has recovered to 60% of pre-COVID levels. We have taken a number of important steps to ensure safety of our food delivery customers, which has been a significant driver of the rebound in our business so far.\u00a0 \nMost of the remaining delta in demand is due to young professionals in large cities migrating to their parents\u2019 homes (often in small town India) where home cooked food is the norm, especially during a pandemic. \nAs offices start opening up, these professionals are now starting to move back to the larger cities. We expect sharp recovery in our order volumes as lockdowns continue to ease and the operating environment continues to improve.\u00a0 \nThe unit economics of our food delivery business has improved consistently over the last 18 months. In Q1 FY20, we used to make a contribution margin of \u2013\u20b947 per order; in Q1 FY21, we made a contribution margin of +\u20b927 per order.\nWe do not believe that the current contribution margin in our business is sustainable in the long term. Over time, we expect contribution margin per order to normalise between +\u20b915-20 per order. Net EBITDA for this business segment is expected to improve, as the growth in order volume hereon should offset any corresponding drop in contribution margin.\n2b \u2013 Dining Out\nOur dining out business grew steadily in spite of headwinds (e.g. logout campaign against Zomato Gold by restaurants in India) with significant gains in EBITDA margins across India and our international markets in FY20.\nThis business is fast moving towards being a transaction-led business where the focus is to close-the-loop with restaurants by encouraging users to pay their eating-out bills through the Zomato app.\nLast month, we rebranded Zomato Gold to Zomato Pro with an enhanced value proposition for both users and restaurants (more details \nhere\n). Deals on Zomato Pro are now only available if a user pays their restaurant bill through the Zomato app.\nOur dining out business segment is the hardest hit as restaurants remain shut for dining-out \u2013 leading to almost negligible revenue across advertising and Zomato Pro. The recovery here is going to be slow. Users will be concerned about social distancing and hygiene and restaurants will need to reorganise themselves to be able to build trust with users on these fronts. \nTo help our industry, we have launched \u2018\nContactless Dining\n\u2019 in India and eight more countries. With Contactless Dining, users can enjoy visiting a restaurant without touching any menu cards or interacting with the restaurant staff.\n2c \u2013 B2B Supplies (Hyperpure)\nHyperpure is growing strongly, and we believe that we have early indications of a strong product market fit. Until now, we have only been serving Delhi and Bangalore with Hyperpure. We have covered a lot of ground in the last two years, and we are now expanding rapidly into new cities. \n3 \u2013 Social Responsibility (Feeding Foundation)\nZomato Feeding Foundation aims to be the largest and most impactful not-for-profit aimed at solving hunger in the developing world.\nThe COVID-19 crisis hit the daily wager community badly \u2013 leading to widespread hunger across the country. Springing into action, Feeding India (the India chapter of Zomato Feeding Foundation) launched \u2018Feed the Daily Wager\u2019 campaign to raise money and provide food support to daily wagers who lost their livelihood during the COVID-19 lockdown. Feed the Daily Wager collected \u20b932 Cr (~$4.2m) which was used to distribute over 65 million meals (in the form of ration kits, see photo below) to the daily wager community. \nAt Zomato, we deeply appreciate the trust our countrymen put in us to make us one of the largest and most impactful social campaigns in the country during the COVID-19 crisis. We are deeply grateful to the thousands of volunteers and partners who helped us (help them) make thousands of tonnes of food reach the needy.\nWorking with the Feeding Foundation team will make you realise (if you don\u2019t already) that the world is full of nice people who want to help make it a better place. We sometimes feel that the world is going to hell, but there\u2019s plenty of good out there \u2013 it just doesn\u2019t get seen as much.\nWe aim to grow our Feeding Foundation community multiple folds going forward. Solving hunger is a massive problem, but a solvable one if all of us just started caring about it enough.\nTeam updates\nIn order to quickly reduce our costs during the initial days of the COVID-19 crisis, we had requested our staff to volunteer for salary cuts. 75% of our employees volunteered for partial salary cuts resulting in a total reduction of 14% in our payroll costs. As of today, all the original salaries have been re-instated, and our net losses of under $1m for July reflect the increased payroll cost already.\nWe strongly believe that a founder in an organisation is not a title, but only a mindset. We announced Mohit Gupta (MG, he leads our food delivery business, among other things) as a founder at Zomato. While the foundation of Zomato was built before MG joined us, he has been instrumental in significantly strengthening it over the last two years. What he and his team have built is a very large part of our business, and our DNA today. \nWhen I introduced the Founders Program a little over a year ago (refer to our \nannual report for FY19\n), I outlined a few qualities that founders must exhibit. These qualities include trustworthiness, commitment and resilience among other things. MG checks all these boxes and more. He never shies away from telling me, or anyone, the truth. \nMG is very committed towards building Zomato for the long term, and has extremely high levels of ownership. His resilience to continue building and aim for victory even during the toughest times, is something a number of people at Zomato lean on as we continue to build Zomato.\nThe way the coronavirus suddenly hit the entire world made me realise that our world runs on an assumption of certainty, while there is none. Nobody, no matter how big or small, poor or rich, has any control over many important aspects of the way this world works. The world will change when it has to. Tough times will happen when they have to. The only way to weather what the world throws at us is by following the old adage \u2013 \u2018tough times don\u2019t last, tough people do\u2019. \nBeing tough means that you handle pressure cooker situations calmly, and continue to find ways to get out of them. The path to building a company is non linear \u2013 you need to make enough of the right calls to make sure that you catch the tailwind, and not make so many bad calls that you get caught in the headwind. \nThat\u2019s all for now. We wish everyone the best of health, and hope that the world gets over the pandemic soon."

        "content": "The economic impact of this pandemic has cut across various sectors. The daily wager community, which forms a large part of India\u2019s workforce, is still struggling to arrange food for their family.\nTo provide a better perspective \u2013 only a fourth of the total employable population had jobs in the first week of the lockdown. This means close to 119 million people lost their jobs within the starting week of the lockdown.\n(1)\n Workers at construction sites, shops, restaurants, delivery staff and local transport systems, who live on daily or weekly earnings saw their daily source of income come to a sudden halt. Even today as the country opens steadily, the economic situation for these daily wagers continues to be grim with a lot of businesses either shutting down and being scaled back.\nWith no earnings to sustain their families, and costs of rental and food to cover, this community has been driven to take extreme measures.\u00a0 From attempting to walk back to their hometown on empty stomachs, to suicides, the news has been full of heart wrenching stories.\u00a0\nIn March, we started \n\u2018Feed the Daily Wager\u2019\n to support this community survive through the pandemic. In these two months, we have been able to distribute close to 6 lakh rations kits, facilitating about 6 crore meals thanks to the contribution of thousands of people across the country. Our teams and delivery partners along with our partner NGOs conducted these drives across 145 cities to make sure food was safely distributed to every family.\nHowever, there is still a lot to be done.\u00a0\nMeals for Migrants\nWe have started the phase II for our program to help migrants who have been on their journey home with no food or even means to it. Zomato Feeding India is now facilitating meals packs for them.\u00a0\nEach meal pack costs us \u20b950 and contains packed food for one, and a bottle of drinking water. So far, with the help of our volunteer network, we have distributed 23.5K meal packs across Bangalore, Chandigarh, Delhi, Gurgaon and Hyderabad.\nHow can you help?\nAt the start of the lockdown, we received overwhelming support from across the country towards \u2018Feed the Daily Wager\u2019. Your continued support can help ensure more people reach home safely and in good health.\u00a0\nYou can select an amount that you wish to \ndonate\n here.\u00a0\nHow will your donations be used?\nWe have identified 40+ transit locations across India \u2013\u00a0 highways, railway stations and bus stops with heavy migrant movement. We are stationing our vans at transit points across several cities which are being used to serve food daily.\nWe have also partnered with multiple local NGOs and volunteers for on ground distribution support.\nWe will send our contributors a transparency report on how and where their funds were utilized. Everyone who contributed to Feed the Daily Wager program will soon hear from us on how their contributions have been utilized to bring happiness to families in need.\nHelp us spread the word\nHere is a whatsapp message you can copy and share within your network:\u00a0\nZomato Feeding India has stationed vans with meal packs at transit points in cities to help migrant workers through their journey home. You can do your bit by donating to \u2018Meals for Migrants\u2019 to help ensure more people reach their destination safely and in good health.\nClick to donate \u2013 \nhttps://www.feedingindia.org/donate/mealsformigrants"

        "title": "Introducing our new ratings system",
        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/new-ratings/",
        "author": "Riddhi Jain",
        "content": "Earlier this year, we \nasked for feedback\n from our community of users and restaurant owners on a new way of showcasing restaurant ratings. We proposed a change in the system where we show two distinct ratings on a restaurant page \u2013 \nDelivery and Dining\n. The two experiences are completely different for a user and it made sense to us that we represent them so on our platform as well.\nLuckily, \nall\n the feedback we got \u2013 from users and our restaurant partners alike \u2013 unanimously reaffirmed what we believed. Today, we have launched the new reviews & ratings system in our latest app release.\u00a0\nYou will now see two ratings on the restaurant page telling you how users have rated food ordering and dining in experience with the chosen restaurant. The color scheme of black and red is retained throughout our app for ease of identification. The ratings will be contextual, i.e. when you are browsing restaurants to order food, you will only see the delivery rating indicated by red stars; similarly when you are planning to go out, you will only see the dining rating indicated by black stars.\u00a0\nThis change is live across our food delivery markets \u2013 India, UAE and Lebanon. In the rest of the world, Zomato users will continue to see a single rating (indicated by black stars) powered by a new and improved algorithm. We hope this improves your browsing experience on Zomato and brings a more accurate prediction of your experience with each restaurant.\n____________\nContinuing to bring you trustworthy reviews\nWe have been working hard on improving our ratings algorithm further. Over the years we have done several cleanups and tweaks to keep weeding out fake reviews, incidences of solicitation and bad actors from our system. We do this to ensure that we bring you 100% genuine and trustworthy reviews when you make your decision of which restaurant to order from/dine at.\u00a0\nWith the most recent change in our algorithm, we have further beefed up our systems significantly (aided by machine learning) to reflect updated experience ratings, and to identify and remove fake reviews comprehensively. Our restaurant partners work extremely hard to ensure that every guest has a memorable experience. We don\u2019t want the hard work of our honest partners to get undermined due to a few bad actors in the system. Some examples of such bad actors are \u2013\u00a0\nUsers offering to write 5 star reviews in exchange for money or free meals\nRestaurants approaching users with a high Foodie Level on Zomato to write positive reviews for them in exchange for consideration\nPR agencies that farm users to write reviews for their clients\u00a0\nWith this change all such\n bad actors and their actions\n \nhave also been identified retrospectively\n, \nand the effect of their actions on a restaurant\u2019s rating will be nullified\n. If a restaurant has engaged in review solicitation of any kind in the past, they will see a negative impact on their ratings with immediate effect.\u00a0\nAdditionally, for restaurants who demonstrate a repeated pattern of solicitation, we will add a banner on their listing so users know that we have detected suspicious activity with respect to reviews by that restaurant.\u00a0\u00a0\nLastly, we want to reiterate that the ratings system of Zomato is at the core of our existence and runs independently without influence or compromise. Effective immediately, our ratings algorithm will be treated as our most precious Intellectual Property, and we will not be releasing any details about how the ratings are calculated. The very small team that knows the ins and outs of the system is bound by an NDA to not disclose it to anyone \nwithin or outside\n the organisation. \nWhy? \nThe fundamental trust that users have on our ratings cannot be undermined by deconstructing the system to optimise for one restaurant. Rest assured, the only way to improve your rating on Zomato is the same as it has always been \u2013 serve good & hygienic food and keep delighting your customers with your service.\nIf you have any feedback regarding the new reviews system, please write to us at \nreviews@zomato.com\n. We will continue to work hard to ensure you always have the best, most trustworthy information of where to eat from."

        "content": "Earlier today, our Founder & CEO, Deepinder sent the following note to Zomato employees.\nTeam,\nI hope you are well. Thank you for standing tall in the face of such unpredictable and unprecedented times across the globe. Today, I have a few updates for you.\nKey initiatives during lockdowns \u2013\nWe continue to deliver food, while focusing heavily on safety \u2013 e.g. contactless delivery, rider temperature checks, restaurant safety certifications, rider safety certifications, etc. Order volumes are down, but safety is our highest priority for the foreseeable future.\n[NEW] \nGrocery delivery\n is now in 185 cities in India and we\u2019re about to launch in UAE and Lebanon. We see long term potential in this segment. Grocery also fits perfectly into our vision of better food for more people.\n[NEW] We have \njust\n launched our \nfood delivery business in Turkey\n \u2013 the team has done a great job making this launch-ready in just of a couple of weeks.\n[NEW] Contactless Dining is the need of the hour for the restaurant industry, and we have already signed up ~25,000 restaurants globally. Our product and engineering team has built an amazing product in just a matter of weeks \u2013 I am sure our customers are going to love using Contactless Dining.\n[NEW] We launched \ntakeaway in Australia, New Zealand and Portugal\n to support restaurants and customers when dining out was completely shut in these markets.\nHyperpure is doing well and we\u2019re soon rolling out a plan to rapidly scale up this business (we just launched our Mumbai warehouse). The new Hyperpure tech platform is getting rave reviews from our operations team, as well as our customers.\nWe have served over 60 million meals to the needy through Feeding India\u2019s Feed the Daily Wager project. 60 million is a huge number \u2013 almost 1.5x the size of our ubiquitous food delivery business.\nRider Relief Fund, Zomato Gold Support Fund\u2026 and so much more\u2026\u00a0\nKudos to every team which pulled in high quality work to achieve what we did in the last few weeks. I am very proud of us, and strongly believe in our resilience and ability to weather this storm.\nA more focused Zomato\nOur business has been severely affected by the COVID lockdowns. A large number of restaurants have already shut down permanently, and we know that this is just the tip of the iceberg. I expect the number of restaurants to shrink by 25-40% over the next 6-12 months. What actually happens, for better or worse, is anybody\u2019s guess.\nAll of this uncertainty inevitably needed us to re-define our business strategy. There\u2019s no going back to the \u2018normal\u2019 \u2013 all we should focus on is building for the \u2018new normal\u2019. Considering what we know at this point, the idea is to make a complete shift towards being a transactions first company, focusing heavily on a \nsmall number of large market opportunities in the food value chain\n.\u00a0\nIn everything we do, we are going to continue to stay true to our mission of \u2018better food for more people\u2019. You will get to know where we are going, through a \nglobal townhall very soon. \nInvites to the global townhall will be sent by the end of day today\n.\nOur financial runway looks solid\nOur burn rate is significantly down from pre-COVID levels. We have enough capital to continue growing our business \u2013 \nare financially stable\n and have a very generous amount of runway in the bank (which is continuing to improve as we bring our burn rate down).\u00a0\nWe remain committed to growing towards our mission at the same pace as before. We will continue to hire people in areas where we need them the most \u2013 primarily in product and engineering.\nWe are, however, going to prepare ourselves for things getting worse\nCOVID-19 has been a black swan event for the world economy; and we do not yet know if we have hit the global minima in this journey with the virus. What we have seen so far might just be the local minima, and the worst might be around the corner.\nTherefore, we need to make sure that we \npreserve as much cash as possible\n to weather the storm if the business environment gets worse, or continues to be the same for the rest of the year or more.\nReducing real estate costs\nOur highest recurring expense today (outside of payroll) is real estate. We have 150+ offices globally, most of which are spaces for our sales & logistics teams. Given how well we have been working from home, we have decided to make partial or full work from home a permanent feature of our lives. Depending on the team you are in, you may have \u2013 \nFull time work from home or at the field (e.g., for sales teams, office presence is only required for large team meetings, gatherings, performance reviews)\nPart time work from home (some days in office, other days at home)\nWork from office (all days in office)\nWe will chat more about this in our upcoming global townhall.\nTemporary reductions in pay\nI thank everyone who volunteered for pay cuts to support our longevity as a business. So many people have volunteered for a 100% pay cut for at least 6 months \u2013 that is something I wouldn\u2019t expect to happen at many other companies. In spite of so many people\u2019s effort, we continue to be short of our salary reduction target.\nStarting June, I am proposing a temporary reduction in pay for the entire organisation. Lower cuts are being proposed for people with lower salaries, and higher cuts (up to 50%) for people with higher salaries.\nIf you have already taken a voluntary cut equal to or more than the proposed temporary reduction in pay, you will \nnot \nbe expected to take an additional cut. This temporary reduction in pay will also be eligible for 2x ESOP grants just like the earlier voluntary cuts.\u00a0\nWe expect these cuts to be discontinued as soon as the economy starts getting back on track. I foresee (and hope) this to be around 6 months from now. We will speak about this in more detail during the upcoming global townhall.\u00a0\nSome tough people calls\nMultiple aspects of our business have changed dramatically over the last couple of months and many of these changes are expected to be permanent. While we continue to build a more focused Zomato, \nwe do not foresee having enough work for all our employees\n.\n \nWe owe all our colleagues a challenging work environment, but we won\u2019t be able to offer that to ~13% of our workforce going forward. \nOver the next couple of days, GG, MG and I will be getting on video calls with impacted employees to walk them through the next steps and help find them jobs as soon as possible. We are going to assure them that we stand by them, and will financially and emotionally support them to the fullest possible extent.\u00a0\nHow are we going to support these Zomans?\u00a0\nOur support covers 4 key vectors \u2013 financial support, outplacement support, healthcare and equity.\n1. Financial support\u00a0\nAll our employees who no longer have any work at Zomato, will continue to be with us at 50% salary for the next 6 months. During this time, outside of the handover period of 1-2 weeks, we expect these folks to spend 100% of their time and energy towards looking for jobs outside of Zomato.\u00a0\nSome impacted employees work with us through manpower agencies and not directly on our payroll. We are going to help these agencies support these employees with two months of severance (vs. 15 days of contractual obligation).\nEach person leaving us will also be allowed to keep their Zomato issued laptops and phones (if any).\n2. Outplacement support\nI, our recruitment team and some other key people, will work as an outplacement team to help impacted people look for jobs.\n3. Equity\nPreviously allocated ESOPs will continue to vest during this period of 6 months, as all these people will remain on our payroll with reduced pay.\u00a0\n4. Health Insurance and Support\nWe will ensure that the current health insurance, wherever provided by Zomato continues for this period along with access to our in-house mental wellness team.\u00a0\nAll benefits from Zomato will lapse as soon as you find another job, or after 6 months, whichever is earlier.\u00a0\nHow will you know whether you have been impacted?\nFor everyone who is impacted \u2013 you will get invites for a zoom call with the leadership team within the next 24 hours. These invites will be sent to you via email and Dingtalk. \nFor everyone who is not impacted \u2013 an email from \nhr@zomato.com\n in the next 6 hours should tell you that your jobs are here to stay\n.\u00a0\nTo everyone who is impacted, I assure you that we have already explored every possible option of retaining your roles, or creating new roles for you. Also, short term cost is not a decision driver here; this will however, end up making Zomato leaner, and improve our chances of success in the long term.\nI thank you for your time and commitment towards building Zomato. You have helped make Zomato what it is today. All of Zomato is grateful to you, and is going to do its absolute best to ensure that this is a smooth transition for you. \nZomato will always be home for you \u2013\u00a0and I wish we continue to enrich your life \u2013 as customers, as well as external custodians of our mission of better food for more people.\nAs always, please reach out to me directly for any ideas, questions or concerns. \n\u2013 Deepi"

With scarce to no income, restaurant workers like cooks, housekeepers and servers have been struggling to meet their daily needs. \nWe launched the Zomato Gold Support Fund to help the restaurant community in the face of an unprecedented crisis. Under the initiative, all proceeds from Gold memberships sold in April 2020 went towards supporting restaurant workers while providing contributors an additional year of membership for free.\nWe are overwhelmed by the positive response the initiative received, collecting \u20b92.64 crores during the month of April 2020 \u2014 made possible by the generous contributions of over 26,000 individuals. All funds collected as part of this initiative have already been disbursed to over 3100 restaurant workers from 378 restaurants, helping them meet their daily livelihoods.\nFurthermore, we are contributing 10% of our collections, or \u20b926.5 lakhs, to the NRAI Covid-19 Relief Fund, an initiative set up by the NRAI to support restaurant workers and their families impacted by COVID-19.\nMany restaurateurs across the country are taking all possible steps to stand by their staff despite the current situation. Some of those who received funds for their staff under the Zomato Gold initiative shared their gratitude towards the initiative:\nWe wish to express a heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to the Zomato Gold Support Fund, be it by purchasing Zomato Gold or helping spread the word. You have supported the restaurant community at a time when it needs you the most. Once these times are behind us, all these restaurants will be back again, ready to welcome you with the same great taste and the lively spirit we all sorely miss."

        "author": "Himanshu Kalra",
        "content": "The world around us is changing at a rapid pace. COVID-19 has impacted us in innumerable ways and is now paving the path to a new, more hygiene-conscious world. This demand for safety and hygiene will likely be a permanent feature in the new world, and will therefore, fundamentally change the way agriculture, and consequently, all F&B businesses, work.\nAt this point, nobody is talking about temporary and (maybe) permanent disruptions to our food supply chain and how they can affect the ongoing operations of F&B businesses. At \nZomato Hyperpure\n, our farm-to-fork business, where we source fresh raw ingredients from farmers to supply to restaurants, we have learnt a lot about what\u2019s going on. We are in a unique position to attempt to understand how the entire value chain for the restaurant industry might get affected in the future. \nThe curious case of Indian Poultry\nAround the middle of February, we saw a trend in the Indian poultry market that countered the global trend of increased poultry consumption. Rumours were spreading that eating chicken could cause COVID-19, and countering the trend across the world, the demand for chicken in India decreased dramatically. In any given year, the lowest prices of poultry are usually observed during the months of February and March, since they have the weather conducive to the birds\u2019 growth. However, decreased demand combined with above average supply led to farmgate prices* crashing down to as low as \u20b96/kg vs the average wholesale per kg price of \u20b980 over the past 12 months (cost of production ranges usually ~\u20b972-78/kg). \nRight now, without any predictability of demand (and pricing), farmers are hesitant to start fresh production batches. Mass selling in a short duration and no fresh batches have led to acute shortage of chicken in India. The current demand across the market is being served by limited fresh chicken production from processor-owned farms and the stocks frozen by processors during the months of February / March. The prices of frozen whole chicken have already gone over \u20b9150/kg (Delhi and Bangalore) while that of fresh chicken is ~\u20b9180/kg (Bangalore). When the lockdown ends and the demand picks up again, the current supply might not be well equipped to meet the demand. \n*pricing data as of mid-April 2020\nAdjusting to changes in the short term\nRestaurants and others in the food industry will need to re-think and re-calibrate their supply chains to fit into the new reality of our world. The poultry industry above is just one indicator of the kind of changes happening across other commodities. Sourcing commodities from international markets will become harder, and local sourcing might gain more traction in order to balance out this disruption.\u00a0\nHere are some measures restaurants may have to undertake in the short term in order to adjust to the supply chain disruption \u2013\nDynamic menus\nRestaurants should keep their menus dynamic to ensure that if a key ingredient for any dish on the menu is unavailable or has become unusually expensive due to shortages, the dish is removed and alternatives explored. \nThe possibility of adding dishes whose raw ingredients become unusually cheap can also be an option (like most restaurants in some countries in Europe have a daily lunch menu \u2013 dishes made from freshly sourced ingredients from the market \u2013 usually the cheaper produce available in the market).\nExample 1 \u2013 Developing basmati rice-based dishes, given the prices of basmati rice are low currently due to export restrictions / bans\nExample 2 \u2013 Prices of alphonso mangoes may continue to be low this year and restaurants (especially in the south of India) can experiment recipes centered around this\nThis might accelerate the need to move away from physical menu cards. Digital menus should help restaurants embrace dynamic menus, and also A/B test a lot of their offerings.\nReimagining recipes\nChefs can work on changing recipes of existing dishes with substitutes that are readily available in the market or have no supply challenges. For example, A lot of our (Hyperpure) customers have shifted to using frozen chicken instead of fresh chicken and chefs are working hard to recalibrate the recipes alongside training their staff on the correct procedure to \u2018thaw\u2019 frozen chicken.\nReducing wastage\nThe other key challenge that restaurants will continue to face in the near term is erratic demand. In such an environment, the most prudent means of controlling wastage would be ordering more frequently and in smaller quantities, even if that entails paying slightly higher prices. Protecting against wastage will be key to keeping costs down in an environment where businesses will be stretched to making their ends meet anyway. \nRecalibrating in the long term\nWe foresee increased consumer awareness and therefore, demand for the highest levels of hygiene standards. The F&B industry will need to revisit the existing supply chain to eliminate any weak links which might compromise on hygiene. Following are some of the trends that might shape up the future of supply chains in the long term \u2013\nReinventing traditional wet markets\nCOVID-19 originated from a wet market* in China which is very similar to a fish, chicken and meat mandi in India. Tonnes of perishable raw material stacked close along with a large number of people congregating together every day make wet markets a high risk zone to contract infections.\n*a wet market is a marketplace selling fresh meat, fish, produce, and other perishable goods\nConsumer demand and regulations are going to fundamentally change the way traditional mandis or wet markets function and exist today. Tech-driven innovations around e-commerce and trading of raw-commodities will shape up how these markets will function in the future.\nThis will affect F&B businesses in very meaningful ways. As a first order effect, we think raw material costs might go up because of stricter and traceable hygiene regulations imposed by governments around the world. In order to offset this increased cost, restaurant menu prices will have to go up \u2013 which will lead to a drop in consumer demand. However, with the increase in menu prices, bill values will go up \u2013 hopefully making the same amount of revenue for a restaurant, even at lower utilisation rates.\nFarm to fork\nLarge restaurants will have to invest significant efforts to re-work their supply chains beyond traditional mandis to more organized and predictable suppliers. This would mean leveraging technology to connect with farmers, millers or brands directly, and removing intermediaries. In the long run this will not only bring down costs but also make sure that the bar on hygiene and quality keeps getting pushed. \nWe are continuously monitoring the market closely and will continue to share our learnings with the partner community so that we are well-equipped to face whatever lies ahead of us."

        "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our lives in ways we had never imagined. Our everyday interaction with the outside world, with public spaces, the retail environment, and even with one another, has come under intense scrutiny. All of this is rapidly reorienting our understanding of personal hygiene and public health. \nWe anticipate that the food service industry, specifically the dining out segment, will experience significant \nand\n permanent changes in the way it operates. Based on some recent consumer surveys, diners are ranking safety assurance and hygiene as their top factors when they choose a restaurant for dine in. \nThe situation demands all of us to keep safety and hygiene standards at the highest priority. Restaurants have forever been the world\u2019s community centres, and it is very important that the staff, and the premises follow best in class practices to keep their staff and their customers safe.\nAll restaurants will have to rethink operations to suit these post-COVID sensibilities of their customers. For the restaurant industry, the pace of recovery will be governed by how quickly it can restore consumer confidence and trust. \nWhile dining out at our favourite restaurants with our near and dear ones seems like a distant dream, at Zomato, we are proactively working on initiatives that will help make the restaurant industry bounce back faster when the current restrictions are lifted, by adopting technology based safety solutions.\u00a0\nIntroducing Contactless Dining\nContactless Dining minimises customer contact with anything that someone else might have touched \u2013\u00a0by eliminating the use of high-touch elements at restaurants. Imagine a full-stack tech enabled dining experience, but with the least risk to health and safety. \nContactless Dining will have the following components \u2013 \nContactless menu \u2013\u00a0scan a QR code on the table to explore the restaurant menu with dish and pairing recommendations\nContactless ordering \u2013 order through the app (you don\u2019t need to talk to the waiting staff to place an order, or modify an order)\nContactless payment \u2013 once done, just pay the bill via the app & leave the restaurant premises\nThis eliminates the need for menu cards and bill books, two articles that are often touched by guests, and are typically unsanitized and could potentially be a source of concern. So far, the waiting staff will still need to bring you your food from the kitchen, but as long as the waiting staff is wearing a mask, and following the highest hand hygiene standards, we should all be okay.\u00a0\nWe are building additional features on the app \u2014 such as the ability to order multiple courses, and the option to pay for yourself or the entire table \u2014 to ensure a hassle-free dining experience.\nContactless Dining also ensures that consumers don\u2019t have to wait to place their order or pay the bill. Thus, making the entire experience far more seamless and convenient for the users.\nContactless Dining is a step forward in the right direction for the restaurant industry; this will provide for a better and hassle free dining experience for customers, and also improve the economics of the restaurant industry \u2013 by helping bring down manpower costs, as well as reducing the table turnover time.\nRestaurant Hygiene & Safety Practices\nAs hygiene takes precedence, we recommend that restaurants judiciously follow the protocols laid out by the health authorities across the world (including WHO). To encourage this, we are adding safety features on the app wherein restaurants will be able to self report safety and hygiene measures that they undertake, such as \u2013\u00a0\nSanitized premise: \nEnsure frequent cleaning/disinfection of high touch points such as tables/door handles etc.\u00a0\nHand sanitization: \nDisplay alcohol-based hand sanitizers prominently around the venue or/and provide hand washing station to the users\nFood hygiene: \nEnsure that all raw meats, seafood, vegetables have been cleaned thoroughly before preparation.\u00a0\nTable layout: \nArranging tables at least one meter apart from each other\nS\ntaff temperature check\n: Ensure daily temperature checks for the restaurant staff\nStaff hygiene and awareness: \nStaff is educated about precautions that are necessary to maintain hygiene in the restaurant. Staff wash their hands thoroughly multiple times a day.\nPrompts on the Zomato app will reveal the restaurant\u2019s hygiene records to assist in informed decision making, and also allow consumers to report any deviations from what has been self-reported by the restaurant. \nWe believe a proactive approach towards safety and hygiene will go a long way in building confidence back in dining out.\nOur teams will start reaching out to restaurants in the coming weeks to educate them about self regulation and Contactless Dining, so that when the lockdown ends, our restaurant partners can inspire confidence in the public and usher a safer, more seamless era of dining experiences."

Two weeks back, we started the \nZomato Gold Support Fund\n to try and ease the burden on the restaurant workers worst affected by this lockdown. As things stand today, we are overwhelmed by the collective response \u2014 from our existing Gold members, new members, and restaurateurs. It gives us heart to see everyone uniting to champion the cause of restaurant workers by generously contributing and spreading the positive word far and wide!\nAs of today, we have raised over \u20b92 cr for the Zomato Gold Support Fund through the contributions of 18500+ individuals. Having received requests from almost 350 restaurants, we are working round the clock to make disbursals seamless and quick. To ensure that the process followed is fair and transparent, we have appointed Grant Thornton as the independent review partner for this initiative. We released the first batch of funds this week, providing immediate relief to almost 900 workers at 105 restaurants.\u00a0\nThe positive feedback we have been getting from restaurant owners only strengthens our resolve to do our best for the restaurants and their staff. Our goal is to keep this momentum going through the month and raise enough funds to help at least 10,000 restaurant workers.\nFurthermore, we are pledging 10% of all proceeds from the Zomato Gold Support Fund to NRAI\u2019s COVID-19 Relief Corpus, which is targeted to provide support to restaurant workers who get diagnosed with or are directly impacted by COVID-19.\nTaking inspiration from the initial response from India, we launched the initiative in UAE last week, and have raised over $60,000 for restaurant workers already. Our teams in Turkey, Portugal and Australia are also working closely with local NGOs to operationalize similar support initiatives.\nTo all the contributors \u2014 thank you for coming forward and lending your support, and we assure you that your contributions will reach only the hands which need it the most.\nTo others, here\u2019s a quick recap of how you can help \u2014 go to the Zomato app and purchase annual Zomato Gold membership for \u20b91200, and we\u2019ll contribute all proceeds to the Zomato Gold Support Fund.

We aren\u2019t even sure how long this situation will last; as far as we can see, the restaurant industry will continue to be in stress for another 6-12 months. \nOur food delivery universe consists of more than 250,000 delivery partners (DPs) in 500+ cities. And the ongoing crisis has affected them adversely as almost 350 cities have little to no business \u2014 leading to 1,00,000+ riders with zero earnings. Given the contractual nature of their work, these DPs depend on daily wages. They have little to no savings (not to forget their monthly rents, children\u2019s education fees and other expenses), and they have hardly anything going on for them.\nKeeping their welfare in mind, we have launched \nRider Relief Fund \nto raise money to support our riders and be able to provide them with at least enough money to be able to buy ration for their families. On top of that, we want to make sure that there is enough money to address any medical emergencies for them as well as their families. \nOne obvious question is \u2013 \u201cWhy is Zomato not taking care of their riders by themselves?\u201d. We really want to, and we are keen on safeguarding every family associated with us, but there is only so much we can do to help in this situation. It\u2019s beyond our financial viability to support our delivery partners. Even though we are asking for your support, we are leaving no stone unturned to make this time easier on our community and our ecosystem \u2013 \nWe have provided COVID insurance to all our riders, distributed masks \u2013 to keep them and our customers safe.\nWe have been educating our riders and restaurants on WHO recommended safety and hygiene practices. Along with our restaurant partners, we have facilitated hand sanitisation stations at more than 50,000 restaurants across the country.\nVoluntary salary cuts \u2013 all Zomans are taking voluntary pay cuts to keep the platform afloat and thus protect livelihoods attached to it. A number of Zomans have taken a 100% salary cut, or donated a significant part of their savings and salaries, to help our community.\nServing those in need \u2013 as we speak, our volunteers are working tirelessly across the nation to get daily supplies to daily wage workers who are the most affected by the COVID-19 lockdown. \nRead more about our Feed the Daily Wager initiative.\n\u00a0\nRead about all our COVID -19 related initiatives here.\nWe appeal to everyone who benefits from the thriving food delivery business, that we have created with our delivery partners, to support the community so that we can all collectively see the other side of this dark tunnel. \nHere\u2019s how you can donate to our Rider Relief Fund on the Zomato app \u2013 \nWe aim to raise \u20b910 crores\n so that we can help channel sufficient funds to our delivery universe, covering all grounds of necessity, be it daily/weekly supplies, medical requirements and other expenses. \u20b910 crores only lets us distribute \u20b91,000 to each of our 1,00,000 delivery partners who are not able to work right now. \nAgain, if you can afford to, we request you to donate to our Rider Relief Fund.

In the past, we have worked with LGUs and the Robin Hood Army in conducting feeding programs to alleviate some of these problems and have achieved great results.\u00a0\nWith this spirit, we are launching the Philippines chapter of our Feeding Foundation. Feeding Philippines. For the fight against hunger during the COVID pandemic, we are proud to partner with \nRise Against Hunger Philippines\n (RAHP) in raising funds for those who need assistance in their daily food needs during this pandemic. \nCurrently, RAHP collects the goods from food manufacturers and other corporate partners to donate their surplus inventory and other resources available to help those in need. Then the supplies are delivered to different areas of Metro Manila and in the provinces of Isabela, Laguna, Cebu, Iloilo, Negros, Misamis Oriental, and Davao. \nHowever, this is not enough to sustain the needs of the assisted families. The quarantine has been extended until April 30 in Philippines, which makes the donations even more critical. Most of RAHP\u2019s assisted families in both poor urban and rural areas are often unemployed or have informal jobs, usually on a no-work-no-pay scheme. \nDuring distribution, social distancing is of prime importance. Instead of expecting the families to gather at one place, the on-ground team is keen on distributing supplies door-to-door, to keep everyone safe. \nHow can you help?\nYour \ndonation\n of PHP100 is equal to 1 food pack good for a family of 8.

Your love and support keeps us going.\nHere\u2019s a summary of everything that we are doing to support our community, and our own business at this time \u2013\u00a0\nFor our customers\nContactless Delivery\n \u2013\u00a0amidst the current lockdown situation in India, ensuring delivery of safe, hygienic food to our customers is paramount for us. To ensure this, we have launched contactless delivery.\n \nCustomers can opt to allow the delivery partner to leave the package outside their home, ensuring no human-to-human interaction and hence lowering risk of any transmission.\nFace masks\n \u2013 we believe that people should wear masks for the sake of others, if not for themselves. In that spirit, we have distributed and continue to distribute \nface masks\n to our delivery partners to keep them, as well as our customers, safe\n \nfrom the spread of an unlikely infection. We are also continuously educating our delivery partners on hygiene practices (not to touch face, nose, sneeze in elbow, etc.) to ensure their own as well as the ecosystem\u2019s safety.\nDisabling COD\n \u2013\u00a0for safety reasons, to avoid contact between our users and delivery partners, we\u2019ve temporarily disabled the CoD (cash-on-delivery) option on our app. \nStrict hygiene standards at restaurants\n \u2013\u00a0we are making a big push to ensure hygiene standards are being followed by restaurants and passing on that information to users so that they can make an informed decision and are \nassured of the safety and hygiene standards of the food.\u00a0\nRestaurants can issue a \nself declaration \non whether they are complying with best practices advised by WHO at their premises, to take precautions against the spread of Coronavirus.\nRestaurants have set up \nhand washing & sanitisation stations \nand are ensuring\u00a0 that restaurant staff as well as delivery partners are using them\n \nregularly.\u00a0\nRestaurants are being encouraged to adopt the practice of \nsanitising their kitchen slabs and utensils\n at periodic intervals.\nRestaurants are also \nchecking the body temperature \nof restaurant staff as well as our delivery partners to ensure that food is not delivered by someone with a higher than normal body temperature.\nDelivery partners are being asked to share a \ndaily self declaration \non their hygiene and health \u2013 normal body temperature, sanitised masks and bags. We are also enforcing policies to ensure adherence to hygiene and health standards.\nGrocery delivery\n \u2013\u00a0we have started grocery delivery in 80+ cities across India to help with the supply of essentials. Our delivery network in the country is only second to India Post, and we are putting in every effort to make sure that we put it to good use to serve the community. We\u2019d like to thank the government authorities, grocery stores, FMCG companies & other start-ups that have come forward to partner with us and support the community in this endeavour.\nZomato Gold Extensions\n \u2013 as a small gesture from our end, we have decided to extend all paid Zomato Gold memberships by two months at zero cost. This will be valid across India, UAE, Australia, Indonesia, Philippines, Lebanon, Turkey, New Zealand, Portugal and Qatar.\nFor our delivery partners\nRider Relief Fund\n \u2013 we have donated money to and are raising funds from the community for the Zomato Rider Relief Fund. This fund is supporting all our delivery partners whose earnings have dropped sharply in the midst of reduced demand for food delivery.\nCOVID Insurance\n \u2013 we have reassured our delivery partners that they don\u2019t need to force themselves to work for financial reasons if they get infected with COVID-19. Zomato\u2019s \nDelivery Partner Insurance Plan\n, which earlier covered only hospitalization, will now also cover lost earnings, in case the delivery partner gets infected by COVID-19.\u00a0\nFor our restaurant partners and restaurant workers\nZomato Gold Support Fund\n \u2013 with the goal of helping out the restaurants that are finding it difficult to support their workers, we have launched the \nZomato Gold Support Fund\n. \nIndividual users can contribute to this cause by purchasing or renewing an annual Gold membership. All proceeds from the Zomato Gold subscriptions in the month of April 2020 will go towards supporting restaurant workers in need and the users will get an additional year of Gold free, as a token of our gratitude. This has already been launched in India and UAE, and will be live in other markets over the next few days.\u00a0\nTakeaway\n \u2013\u00a0we are launching takeaway\n \nin \nAustralia and Portugal\n, to support restaurants in the current situation and also help our users, with what is a need of the hour in these times.\nOur underprivileged community \u2013 India\u2019s daily wage workers\nFood Security \n\u2013 Zomato\u2019s mission is \u2018better food for more people\u2019.

The purpose of Feeding Foundation is to leverage our relationship with the food industry, and our users to be able to provide food security to millions of people who run the risk of dying from hunger. In the middle of this chapter, we also started the Philippines chapter of the Feeding Foundation, called Feeding Philippines.\nFeed the Daily Wager \n\u2013\u00a0about 450 million Indians depend on daily wages to run their household and have lost their livelihoods due to the lockdown. All these people are going hungry and they desperately need someone\u2019s support. To help with the situation, we started the \u201cFeed the Daily Wager\u201d initiative in India, wherein we are\n distributing ration kits to daily wager communities.\n These ration kits provide 100 meals to a family (three meals a day for a family of five, for a week).\nThis initiative is powered by people like you \u2013 we have been able to raise \u20b925 crores for this from individuals and corporates, and are aiming to double the amount. If you haven\u2019t already done so, please donate towards feeding our daily wagers at \nhttp://www.feedingindia.org/donate\n; countless drops fill an ocean \u2013 please add yours.\nWe have already distributed more than 100,000 ration kits (to the same number of daily wager families) in more than 20 cities as of now. Apart from our mega cities, we have now also started distributing these ration kits in other cities like Patna, Jhansi, Guwahati, Dehradun etc.\nWe plan to distribute 1M ration kits as part of this initiative, and have already secured supplies to do that. \nWorking for Feeding India is incredibly humbling. Here are some images and conversations that will move you.\nFor people who are directly affected by COVID-19\nFood for quarantine facilities\n \u2013\u00a0as an essential service provider, it is important we find more than just a few ways to help our community fight against this pandemic. We have teamed up with Apollo Hospitals to \ndeliver food to those who are in isolation wards\n, in their quarantine facilities. We are currently doing this in Bangalore and Hyderabad, and are expanding this support to hospitals/quarantine facilities across major cities.\nThat\u2019s all for now. If there is anything else you think we can/should do, please write to me at \nd@zomato.com\nStay safe."

And a cash-strapped industry is struggling to provide sustenance for them and their families as business comes to an abrupt halt.\nZomato is built around \u2014 and is an integral part of \u2014 this very hospitality ecosystem, connecting millions of consumers with passionate restaurateurs every day. In times like these, companies like ours need to step up and do our best to power the ecosystem through this unprecedented environment. \nKeeping these circumstances in mind, in order to help the restaurant industry get back on its feet, all revenue from the Zomato Gold subscriptions we sell in April will go into the \nZomato Gold Support Fund\n.\nAll proceeds to the fund will go towards restaurant housekeepers, cooks and servers in these uncertain times. \nRecipients of these funds will not be required to pay us back.\nThe ongoing lockdown is affecting certain members of our society more severely than the rest. In this hour, we must chip in for restaurant workers till things get back to normal.\nHow can individuals contribute?\nYou can contribute by purchasing or extending the annual Gold membership for \u20b91200 on the \nZomato app\n. We will give you an additional year\u2019s extension for free as a token of our gratitude, and all the proceeds of the membership fee that you pay today will go towards the support of restaurant workers.\nWe want to raise as much as we can, and positively impact the lives of millions who depend either directly or indirectly on restaurant workers across the country. And once the testing times are behind us, these restaurants will be there to welcome us like never before. \nLet\u2019s get together in support of those who serve us!"

That means, about 450 million Indians depend on daily wages to run their household.\n(1)\nWith the recent lockdowns in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, almost all of us have quickly adapted to working from home, while a large part of our community has been going to bed without knowing if they will be able to afford a meal for their family the next day. Workers at construction sites, shops, restaurants, delivery staff and local transport systems, the daily wager community has seen their only source of income come to a screeching halt, leaving them with no means to earn themselves a meal during these days of lockdown. Hunger and desperation prevails, and we can do something to help our fellow citizens.\nZomato Feeding India has initiated \u2018Feed the Daily Wager\u2019 to address this issue and help ensure that less people sleep hungry during this period of lockdowns.\nWhat is \u2018Feed the Daily Wager\u2019?\nAs part of this campaign, we will provide food support to the daily wager communities that are currently unable to support their family\u2019s food requirement. We have made ration kits containing wheat flour or rice and two types of pulses required for a family of 5 for one whole week.\u00a0\nEach kit will cost us Rs.500 and will be delivered to locations across multiple cities. We have partnered with local NGOs across these cities to help us distribute these kits responsibly while adhering to the social distancing norms, to ensure safety of volunteers and beneficiaries.\u00a0\nFor this, we will need a total fund support of Rs 50 crores from our donors.\u00a0\nRead more below to know how you can contribute.\nWho can contribute?\nAnyone and everyone who understands how important the daily wager community has been for our society and would like to help ensure they and their families don\u2019t sleep hungry during these testing times, can contribute through our \nwebsite\n.\u00a0\nHow does it work?\nStep 1: Select an amount that you wish to\u00a0donate \nhere\n. The amount required to feed one family of 5 for a week is Rs.500.\u00a0\nStep 2: We have partnered with the good folks at Grofers and Big Bazaar, to help us organize these ration kits across multiple cities. Once the donation is received, these ration kits will be delivered to a local hub in the city.\nStep 3: We have partnered with multiple local NGOs who work for the development of these workers around their place of residence. They will help ensure that the kits are distributed responsibly and hygienically.\u00a0\nStep 4: We will send our contributors a transparency report on how and where their funds were utilized.

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "Over the last few years, the nature of the restaurant industry in India has changed, and food delivery has become a more important part of the ecosystem. At Zomato, we have started our own delivery fleet, launched ground-breaking products, and have learnt so much with each passing year.\u00a0\nOur users have posted 283m+ ratings and reviews across dining out and delivery experiences, and 54m+ photos on Zomato till date, making us one of the largest food and restaurant discovery platforms in the world.\u00a0\nWe also understand the power of such reviews and ratings and the impact they have on our users and restaurants. Our users religiously use Zomato ratings to decide whether they should go out to, or order in from a restaurant.\nSo far, a restaurant rating has been an amalgamation of dining and food delivery reviews received by a restaurant (50-50% weightage).\u00a0\nHowever, as the food delivery industry matured, we have started noticing a significant disparity between the average dining rating, and the average delivery rating for the same restaurant. There are thousands of restaurants that offer great experiences on-premise, but fail to live up to expectations when you order food from them. On the other hand, there are thousands of other restaurants that have mastered the art of food delivery, but their on-premise experience leaves much to be desired.\nOver the last few months, we have been thinking about a new way to showcase a restaurant\u2019s reality most accurately. This new approach gets rid of the unified rating for a restaurant, and splits the rating for dining and delivery.\u00a0\nGoing forward, we are also planning to let our community clearly state the context of their review on Zomato. Like this \u2013\u00a0\nWe want your feedback\u2026\nThis is a big change for us. And we want to make sure that we do right by our community of millions of reviewers who leave these reviews to guide each other in making the best food choices.\u00a0\nDo you think this is a valuable change for you? Whether you like it or not, we would love to hear from you. We are listening at \nreviews@zomato.com\n \u2013 this change will only be made once we have enough feedback from each one of you, and when we improve (or can) this product.\nIt goes unsaid, that we\u2019ll continue to work towards providing you the best experience whenever you use Zomato."

        "content": "I just finished 10 years at Zomato. I started at Zomato as a Data Collection Executive \u2013 I used to go through every street in Bangalore, collect updated menus from restaurants, identify new restaurant openings, and permanently \u2018shut\u2019 restaurants on Zomato when they ceased to exist in the real world. My job was to ensure that Zomato reflects the real-life status of the restaurant industry, as much as physically possible.\u00a0\nNowadays, I\u2019m personally overlooking the global accounts and chains within Bangalore and ensuring every piece of content associated with them is up to date and is being reflected correctly on our platform. Zomato has taught me a lot, and I have learnt a lot. Not many people know that teaching and learning are two different things. I am grateful to Zomato for giving me the opportunity to do so much more than I ever thought would be possible.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s true what they say about Zomato, things move pretty fast here and one has to move along with it and grab every opportunity we get to learn something. And trust me, one gets many of those here.\nThat\u2019s how this past decade was for me \u2013 extraordinary, hyper-paced, and nothing short of amazing.\u00a0\nI still remember the day I got a call from Pankaj (Co-Founder, Zomato). This was in Feb 2010 when he had simply come across my profile on Naukri.com, and had called me for a quick telephonic interview.\u00a0\nAs you may have guessed, that call went well and I boarded a train to Delhi immediately after, not realising that this new journey will completely change my life. It was my first time in Delhi, and Pankaj had personally come to pick me up from the station. We went to Deepi\u2019s (CEO and Chief of Product, Zomato) house right after and completed all joining formalities and training sessions.\u00a0\nCan you imagine that things were as simple as that when I started off here? Or rather when Zomato was coming into its own. No processes, no fixed structure, no hierarchy, no big offices, or fancy facilities, but a big dream driven by determined individuals.\u00a0\nOnce my training concluded, I was posted to Bangalore, from where I reported with daily numbers to our team in Delhi. And right after a couple of months of me shifting here, we took restaurant listings live for the city of Bangalore.\nSince we didn\u2019t have a permanent establishment in this city at the time, our team worked out of different cafes every single day. This was till we shifted to an office, which wasn\u2019t exactly like a conventional workplace, but more of a conference room. That\u2019s how life was at Zomato back then. But as our team grew bigger, from 7 to 20 people, we moved to a bigger space in Koramangala.\u00a0\u00a0\nFrom being the first employee hired in Bangalore and working with a team of 20 people, we now have our very own office in Koramangala with a strength of 350+ Zomans! How awesome is that?\nDuring my early years in Bangalore, my main task was to explore the city to gather details and collect hard copies of restaurant menus. We simply bought a Nikon camera, walked through popular streets and markets, clicked numerous photos and finally took a bus back to work. This was my routine for 4 whole years.\u00a0\nI have also witnessed a great number of changes and upgrades over the years at Zomato, not only to its scale as an organisation, but also to our daily lives at work and how they were changing simultaneously. To collect data effectively, we upgraded to BlackBerry phones for easy access to map coordinates and from using public transportation to our very own scooters, which made our daily routines a lot easier. And now, this entire process has been completely transformed as it simply takes us a few minutes to compile restaurant data and visuals, through the \u2018Zomato Collect\u2019 app.\u00a0\nFor a long time, I was the only Data Collection Executive in Bangalore, which not only helped me learn about what I did and the impact it could create, but also helped me in getting to know the city better.\u00a0\nMy exposure to this city and the experience of building it from scratch has helped me program manage other city launches as well. I was involved with the launch of content and the training of our employees in some of our biggest markets in India such as Delhi, Kochi, Chennai, Hyderabad, Mysore, Mangalore, and Goa.\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine how we were just another startup in 2010 and now we are Zomato, an organisation that has expanded its offerings to 24 countries and is delivering food to over 500 cities within India. It\u2019s unstoppable, isn\u2019t it?\u00a0\nI only feel a sense of pride when I look back at the years I\u2019ve spent here, they were completely worth it; and I look forward to a lot more in the next few years. From what I feel, the next 10 are going to be more exciting than the last 10."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/food-preparation-time/",
        "author": "Deepankar Pal",
        "content": "Have you ever wondered why we, as humans, have always gravitated towards things which can be done instantly? Why do instant noodles, instant coffee or ready-to-eat packed food find a place in our kitchens?\u00a0\nWe as a species simply hate to wait. We believe the same goes for food. A couple of questions that always crop up in our minds are \u2018Where is my food?\u2019 or \u2018When will my food arrive?\u2019\u00a0\nFor Zomato, from the moment a customer opens the app and until their food arrives at their doorstep, it is important for us to provide accurate information on when their food will be delivered. Giving a higher than actual time estimate can deter customers from ordering as does estimating lower than actual delivery time, which can then increase inflow to our customer support.\nHence an accurate time estimation not only results in better customer experience but can also reduce the burden on our customer support teams.\u00a0\nWhat happens once an order is placed?\nAs showcased above, in the food delivery ecosystem, multiple handshakes happen once a customer places an order.\u00a0\nEach of these steps has a time component associated with it, i.e., the time it will take for the restaurant to prepare the food (Food Preparation Time, FPT), the time it will take for our Delivery Partner (DP) to reach the restaurant (DP pick up time), and the time it will take for our DP to reach the customer\u2019s address (DP drop time).\u00a0\nAll of these, plus a few other time components (predictable and unpredictable) play out together to finally compute the time from order placement to final delivery that is then showcased to our customers.\u00a0\nHow does a better FPT prediction help?\nZomato\u2019s online food delivery platform has restaurants across 500+ cities with 400+ cuisines in India, which clearly tells us that one can find diversity in every nook and corner of this nation.\u00a0\nThe scale of business demands better FPT prediction, which in turn helps in better delivery time, better allocation of DPs in order assignment and efficient delivery of orders. It also helps us to engage better with our Restaurant Partners for monitoring FPT breaches and compliance.\nWhat factors contribute to FPT prediction?\nThere are multiple factors that affect the FPT for a particular dish. Say a customer orders Chicken Biryani (D1) from two restaurants (R1 and R2) \u2013\u00a0\nR1 is a restaurant which specializes in making Biryani.\nR2 is a multi-cuisine restaurant with Biryani as one of the dishes, in addition to others.\nAll other scenarios being the same, one would expect FPT of Chicken Biryani from R1 to be less than that of R2 since \u2013\u00a0\nR1 specializes in Biryanis and one expects their kitchen capacity as well as their food preparations to be geared towards preparing Biryanis. Also, they might have optimized their process for minimum Biryani preparation time.\nR2 caters to a wide range of food options, it probably won\u2019t have processes optimized for a particular item, as the same kitchen is shared for multiple dish preparations.\nBut there might be certain additional factors at play here \u2013\u00a0\nQueued orders \u2013 These are the number of orders already in queue for each restaurant. It\u2019s possible that one restaurant has a long queue and another restaurant has no active orders.\nFine dining restaurants vs delivery kitchens \u2013 If one restaurant happens to be a fine dining establishment and another a delivery kitchen, the latter is expected to have a shorter FPT.\nOpening hours \u2013 This refers to the period for which the restaurant has been opened for delivery. Has it opened just now or has been open for a while? These are soft parameters that convey whether the kitchen is in full flow or not.\nOther items in order \u2013 In addition to the Chicken Biryani, what are the other items in the order? Can the items be prepared in parallel or would they be prepared sequentially or do those individual items have a higher or lower FPT?\u00a0\nThat\u2019s a lot of components to keep in mind!\nHow did we represent these components?\nGiven the nature of the problem, we divided it into two major components \u2013\u00a0\nItem Level Information\n, i.e., the item composition of the order\nAs suggested earlier, different items would have a different preparation time.\nHigher quantity orders may take a little more time.\nRestaurant Level Information\n, i.e., the inherent characteristics and nature of a Restaurant with respect to food preparation time\nFast food or delivery only restaurants would have a different behaviour compared to fine dining.\nThe kitchen capacity of each restaurant may vary.\n1. Encoding Item Level Information\nWe notice that the Item level information is usually in text format. In order to use text information in machine learning models, the most common methods are \nBag-of-Words, Tf-Idf or Word2Vec Embedding\n. The first\u00a0two methods fail at our scale because they encode the information in a One Hot Encoding (this is a method where data is converted into forms that help better prediction). Given that the distinct number of dishes on our platform is ~3.5m, this would have resulted in millions of columns being added to our data. The same reason stands for Tf-Idf. \nWe discarded those two approaches because \u2013\nData constantly increases with the increase in the number of dishes (more number of new dishes are getting added to our platform every day).\nHigh dimensionality \u2013 It would require a lot of storage and might create latency issues during model serving.\nSubsequent ML models have sparsity issues and hence models would be less robust.\nFor us, \nWord2Vec\n embedding became the preferred choice because \u2013\u00a0\nIt allowed us to embed the item level information in lesser memory.\nIt allows the model to learn the behaviour of similar items in terms of cuisine and preparation style.\nThe above image is a visualisation and subsequent clustering of menu item vectors trained using \nWord2Vec\n. One can see how different clusters are being formed. For example, all types of Biryanis are together, but are far off from Milkshakes, which is expected as they are fundamentally different dishes.\nAn order seldom contains only one item. In such a scenario, we take the quantity and cost weighted average of item vector to get to the final menu representation. Shown below \u2013\u00a0\nLet\u2019s take an Order for example containing N items. \nFinal order representation is a weighted average of the cost of each item and the quantity ordered.\n2. Encoding Restaurant Level Information\nGiven that in a month, food is ordered from about 150k+ restaurants, understanding how a restaurant could be represented numerically for a machine learning model, becomes the most essential part of this puzzle.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn our case, a restaurant is represented by categorical data. Categorical data is very common in business datasets. For example, users are typically described by country, gender, age groups, etc. Products are often described by product type, manufacturer, seller etc.\u00a0\nThe most used category representations are One Hot Encoding, Encoding Categories with Dataset Statistics, or Encoding Categories as Cluster labels.\u00a0\nCategorical data is extremely convenient for comprehension but very hard for most machine learning algorithms, due to these reasons \u2013\u00a0\nHigh cardinality \u2013 categorical variables may have a large number of levels (e.g., city or restaurants), where most of the levels appear in a relatively small number of instances.\nMany machine learning models (e.g., SVM) are algebraic, thus their input must be numerical. Using these models, categories must be transformed into numbers first before we can apply the learning algorithm.\nThe basic premise is, we let a neural network calculate the best representation of a restaurant by itself. Entity embedding is a vector (a list of real numbers) representation of an entity, which is a restaurant in this case.\u00a0\nThe above image is a T-SNE plot (commonly used to visualise high dimensional data) of the most ordered from restaurants in Bangalore, where restaurants serving similar cuisines and dishes are clubbed together.\nX = {Current Order Level Information, Order Vector, Restaurant Vector}\nY = Food Preparation Time\nWe initialise an embedding matrix representing each restaurant with \u2018m\u2019 dimensions. Each column of the embedding matrix represents one restaurant. Then using various features related to an order, the X-Vector is passed through a neural network. Through backpropagation, the restaurant representations get updated with each iteration along with the weights.\nRead more\n for information on Categorical Embedding.\nHow did we train our model?\nXGBoost\nThrough the embedding matrix, we get the final restaurant representation and then we pass the same X-Vector, as in the entity embedding architecture, to an XGBoost Regressor Model.\u00a0\nDeep Learning Architecture\nOur previous model architecture couldn\u2019t take into account the previous sequences of orders, which came to the restaurant; both the completed orders as well the current running orders.\u00a0\nOne expects that if in \u2018previously completed orders\u2019 there was an order of Butter Chicken, then subsequently predicting FPT of a Butter Chicken order should be nearabout the past value. Passing information sequentially will better understand the kitchen capacity and behaviour at time \nt\n. FPT of a restaurant could also be understood as a time series with its various amplitudes of the series (denoting FPT of the order) depending on the item being cooked. Hence, we narrowed down to using a sequential architecture to better represent a restaurant\u2019s kitchen.\u00a0\u00a0\nBoth running orders (running orders at time T, at max 5 running orders) and completed orders (last 5 completed orders) are passed through a \nstacked LSTM Layer\n. The resulting column vector is concatenated with the present order features and the Restaurant Embedding Vector.\u00a0\nThe resulting column vector is passed through a 2 layer dense network and regressed on FPT.\u00a0\nThrough this, we were able to reduce our mean absolute error from 4.64 mins to 4.13 mins and mean squared error from 32 to 28.\nEnhancements to our model and next steps\nIn addition to the encoding of data across restaurants and dishes, we were further able to enhance the model with a restaurant level information input of preparation time.\u00a0\u00a0\nPreviously, we used to calculate FPT as the difference between the restaurant accepted order timestamp and DP order pick up timestamp. This didn\u2019t result in true FPT as the behaviour of a particular DP during order pick up became a part of the equation. This ideally shouldn\u2019t be the case as FPT is a restaurant phenomenon. In order to correct this, we introduced a Food Order Ready (FOR) button in the Restaurant Partner app.\u00a0\nThey can now mark this whenever the food items are prepared and are ready for pick up.\n \nIn our initial results,\n we saw a 9 percent improvement within 5 minutes accuracy for our prediction. As the compliance of FOR increases, our prediction results become even more accurate.\nWe are also moving towards the newest and most exciting paradigm in the world of data science \u2013 Reinforcement Learning, i.e., a self-learning system, which updates weights as per real-time errors observed at a restaurant level.\u00a0\nGiven that food preparation time represents real-time behaviour, making such a system will be a more elegant solution for this problem statement, ensuring a smoother order tracking experience for our customers."

        "content": "Zomato brings us closer to the food we love in many different ways. It\u2019s a one-stop-shop for finding the best pizzerias to order from, quirky cafes for perfect weekend brunches, or the newly opened brewhouses.\nAs our platform has evolved over the years, and we expanded our offerings even further, the search and discovery experience became more and more fragmented. A couple of months ago, our team took on a challenge of \nrefreshing the UI/UX for our users\n and at the center of this effort was the unification of the\n search \nand\n discovery\n experience.\u00a0\nIn this post (Part 1: Product Framework, Part 2: Technology Architecture), we will share our process and learnings while building a personalized flexible search and discovery experience at Zomato.\u00a0\nPart 1 \u2013 Product Framework\nIf you are a Zomato user, you must have noticed multiple search bars across our previous app. We had custom built search experiences for individual use-cases such as online ordering, Zomato Gold, etc. These search funnels allowed limited search spaces, and also had different interfaces. Not only was this confusing for our users, it required maintenance of multiple UI elements, APIs and analytics. So, it was clear to us that we needed to offer a unified experience for search, irrespective of the use-case.\u00a0\nOne Search\nTo unify the search experience for the v14 app, we defined our search space as a combination of \nentities \nand \nintents\n. We offer multiple entities (such as restaurants, cuisines, dishes, attributes, collections, etc.) that you can search for with an intent (online ordering, self pickup, going out for a meal, going out for a drink) in mind. Our unified search, needs to account for relevance in this wide search space and hence requires us to \nguess\n both the \u2018entity\u2019 as well as \u2018intent\u2019.\u00a0\nExplicit vs Implicit Signals\nWhen you start typing your query (explicit signal), there are multiple results that can be candidates for it. We assign a \ntext match score\n to each candidate. For certain entities, like restaurants, cuisines, and dishes, we also have a \npopularity score, \nwhich is derived from user interest (searches, orders, page views) in these entities\n.\u00a0\nIn addition to this, there are implicit signals that help us predict the intent. For example, if you are at a saved location, chances are that you might be looking to order in. Similarly, on a weekend you are more likely to go out for drinks. So, signals such as location, session activity, time of day, day of the week, as well as your search, order history, etc. are used to formulate an \nintent score\n for each search.\u00a0\nBy combining the \ntext score, popularity score \nand \nintent score\n, we assign a combined \nrelevance score\n to each entity-intent result. We use this score to rank our results.\u00a0\nWhen the \nrelevance score\n of one of the results crosses a defined threshold, we declare the result as the \nleader\n. In a leader state, we dismiss other result candidates and give more prominence to the results of the leader entity to bring more contextual results right on the autosuggestion page. Currently, we are able to detect leaders in about 65% of queries. This is an ongoing effort, and we hope to take this to 90% in the next few weeks so that you can search accurately and faster.\u00a0\nDiscovery\nAfter you tap on a result of a search query, or navigate to a cuisine page, you land on a list of restaurants. For broad intents or dense neighbourhoods, there can be hundreds of restaurants in the result set. We noticed our users get indecisive if there are a lot of results for them to choose from (click through rate of broad intents is lower than that of narrower intents). So to help you \u201cfilter\u201d your result set, we built suggested filters. By mapping related entities and collecting data on which filters get used in which context, we compiled a filter graph.\u00a0\nThis graph currently powers our \nSuggested Filters\n rail. These filters are contextual i.e., if you search for \nCafes\n, filters like \nNearest to me\n, \nWiFi\n, \nOutdoor Seating\n are suggested. If you are looking for online ordering, \nPreviously Ordered\n, \nExpress Delivery\n filters are suggested and so on. \u201cSuggested Filters\u201d are also personalized i.e., your most used and recently used filters are suggested for quick access.\u00a0\nPersonalization with a server configurable UI\nOur new design system, Sushi\n, is a modular framework comprised of re-usable components that can be put together, lego-style, to craft any use-case as needed. We can push new UI elements to any page, without the need for an app update, akin to content on the web frameworks. This is amazingly powerful yet flexible. Across our latest app, we use this backend configurability to serve personalized, contextual search pages that can adapt and evolve with our platform. Some of the UI elements and their use-cases are shown below.\u00a0\nBillboards \u2013 used to set the context of a search page and to promote offers. These are digital versions of the real world billboards.\u00a0\nRails \u2013 they break the monotony of a list and promote discovery within a context. You will come across restaurant, cuisine and multiple other rails through your interactions with the app.\u00a0\nHero text on restaurant cards \u2013 used to surface restaurant offers, events and other contextual information.\u00a0\nUniversal Tracking\nAnother core feature with this update has been end-to-end interaction tracking. Every user interaction (impression and tap) registers itself with the \nsearch_id \nof its parent page and when a user navigates to another page (taps on a restaurant, collection, cuisine, applies a filter, etc.), the new page registers a \nprevious_search_id\n along with its own \nsearch_id\n. This way, by \njoining\n on \nprevious_search_ids \nand new \nsearch_ids\n, we can quantify more than just uni-directional funnels and get a tap-by-tap understanding of user behaviour in different contexts. This is going to be central in our efforts to understand and improve the discovery experiences going forward.\u00a0\nRapid Experimentation\nCombining a server configurable UI with integrated end-to-end tracking has now empowered us to conduct insanely rapid and powerful experimentation at scale. Product development demands a lot of iterations, and now we are able to quickly rollout A/B tests and staged feature releases to validate the product\u2019s success. At any given time, we have a number of experiments going on and this experimentation remains at the core of our product development endeavors at Zomato.\u00a0\nIn conclusion, so far, we talked about the product framework for powering the new Search and Discovery experience at Zomato. Such a flexible UI/UX requires a comprehensive, yet lean contract with the backend. Plus, we built a dedicated service to handle all this at a massive scale.\nStay tuned for Part 2 of this post, that talks about the architecture of the new search service and how it communicates with the app."

        "content": "A few weeks back, we witnessed a restaurant led push against Zomato Gold, where some restaurants abruptly \u2018logged out\u2019 of Gold expressing some dissatisfaction with some user policies of Gold. That led us to speak to and collect feedback from hundreds of our Gold partners. Based on the feedback we received, we rolled out some changes to Gold. \nThe changes were intended to create a more balanced program by addressing the concerns of the community that is the foundation of every business that Zomato is in \u2013 our restaurant partners. \nOver two months have passed since the changes were rolled out, we wanted to understand the reaction of the restaurateur community to the proposed changes. \nA couple of weeks ago, we rolled out a survey to our restaurant partners \u2013 \nQuestion \u2013 Of the changes that were made to Zomato Gold recently, which change had the most positive impact?\nToday, we have the results of the survey. \n\ud83d\udc4d\n Maximum of two unlocks per table\n was the most valued change for the restaurateur community. 40% respondents chose this as the change with the most positive impact.\n\ud83d\udc4d\n One unlock per day\n was the second most valued change with 25% respondents choosing this option, while customer feedback from partners and \nblocking of abusive/low-rated users\n was a close third with 22% respondents.\n\ud83d\udc4e\n Discontinuation of Gold trial packs\n didn\u2019t come up as an important reason with only 9% of respondents choosing this option.\n\ud83d\udc4e\n Revised Gold membership pricing\n was the least impactful change with only 4% restaurant partners finding this meaningful. \n\ud83d\udc4d\n Over 70% of the respondents\n agreed that the changes we introduced in Gold made it a more sustainable program for restaurants to participate in.\nWe are delighted that the changes have garnered a positive reaction from the community. We will continue reaching out and collaborating with the restaurant community to understand their pain points and address it as far as possible.\nWe have also added a large number of restaurants on the Gold network in the recent past, along with adding Gold to our delivery platform. \nIn fact, \nOctober has been one of the best months for us for Gold \u2013 we have welcomed ~110K new Gold members in India alone \u2013 which is the highest number of Gold memberships we have sold so far in a month\n \u2013 this shows that in spite of all the hiccups in the journey of Gold in the recent months, including the pricing changes, it still remains a much wanted and much loved product by our users.\nWe are more charged up and ambitious about Gold than ever before. Now that we know that the program (in its new avatar) is welcomed by the restaurant community, we are even more excited to take it to newer heights.\nWe continue to grow our partner network and now have over 15K+ restaurants across dining out and delivery. Here are some of our top restaurant partners \u2013\nWe are thrilled about the journey ahead, and taking Gold to newer heights with the active participation of our restaurant partners.\nHere\u2019s a little teaser about what\u2019s coming up as part of Zomato Gold \u2013 \n\u2b50 \nGold Specials\n \u2013 for our Gold customers, to extend their Gold privileges, we will soon add some special deals and offers from some of the biggest and busiest restaurant names in the industry (all on top of what we already have on Gold).\n\ud83d\ude97 How about \nfree valet parking\n in the biggest malls? Yes, Gold customers will very soon start to have the privilege of free valet parking in some of their favourite mall properties.\n\ud83e\udd14 Stay tuned\u2026"

        "content": "As all Apple fans would say, we have seen iOS revolutionise the mobile operating system since 2007. Each year, we see iOS redefine simplicity and usability for its users. Isn\u2019t that what the masses look for \u2013 something that\u2019s super easy to understand, super easy to use, with minimal cognitive overload. It just works! If a system doesn\u2019t make a user think, then the system does really know them well.\u00a0\nSpecifically for developers, Apple has ensured that it does not only provide a well designed platform to build upon, but also one that is secure at the same time. Even though, at this point in time, India would only account for a small number of iOS users, there is still a large section of passionate developers who wish to develop and engineer iOS apps in the Indian subcontinent.\u00a0\nKeeping this in mind, we organised our 7th Huddle on iOS \u2013 to explore the latest developments, frameworks and best practices utilised to tackle challenges in this space.\u00a0\nWhat we saw was an inflow of 60 developers from organisations such as 1Mg, Goibibo, PayTM, Ixigo, Nokia, Nykaa, Droom, and many more on a beautiful rainy afternoon at the Zomato headquarters.\u00a0\nFor those who couldn\u2019t be there, here is a brief of what our expert speakers had to say \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRitesh Gupta (iOS Developer, Over)\n\u00a0\nTopic: \nHandling complex async tasks using Combine\nRitesh walked us through Apple\u2019s recently announced\n (at WWDC\u201919)\n reactive framework called Combine. He focused on how Combine, as a tool, works best to ensure effective solutions for the growing complexity in today\u2019s apps.\u00a0\nBy using Combine, developers can \u2013\u00a0\nHandle multiple async tasks with ease\n \u2013 Combine has numerous operators which have different strategies to tackle multiple async tasks such as merge, zip, combineLatest, etc.\nAchieve better state management\n \u2013 In imperative programming, the state tends to spread across the app, but with Combine we can keep it bounded to a stream and transform the value as required for individual subscribers\nDefine loosely coupled components\n \u2013 Combine allows us to create atomic components via publishers or subscribers, which are composed together using operators such as merge and zip, leading to incredibly simple solutions\n2. \nNadzeya Stsepanchuk (iOS Developer and Instructor)\nTopic: Tips and Tricks for smooth table scrolling in iOS\nOur apps are constantly getting updated and are being fed with large amounts of data to meet consumer curiosity and demand. This makes it even more essential for developers to carefully achieve smooth scrolling, with an increasing level of detail for each aspect displayed.\u00a0\nNadzeya gave us insights into some tips and tricks that can help ensure the best possible performance of an app, while using UITableView. As a developer \u2013\u00a0\na. \nWith respect to cell optimisations, it may be useful to \u2013\u00a0\nAvoid reusing cells if they don\u2019t need to be reused. It\u2019s best to create once and cache it\nAvoid showcasing any loaders on cells\nAvoid reloading a cell if data is the same. Store or calculate all the data in a ViewModel if possible\u00a0\nb.\n With respect to image optimisations, it\u2019s preferable to \u2013\u00a0\nGet images with exact size from the API\nResize images to the exact size in a background thread\nIncorporate frameworks such as Texture to render images in the background\nc. \nWith respect to label optimisations, it\u2019s important to \u2013\u00a0\nHave an opaque background for them\nAvoid using attributed string\nNot resize label via sizeToFit() to avoid additional calculations\n3. \nAamir Anwar (Software Development Engineer, Zomato)\nTopic: SwiftUI \u2013 A brand new framework engineered to design apps using a declarative paradigm\nAamir\u2019s talk focused on another new framework introduced by Apple at WWDC 2019 called SwiftUI, which embodies a declarative paradigm for building user interfaces on Apple Platforms.\u00a0\nHe kicked off the session by going over the basics and then exploring areas such as SwiftUI with Combine, Diffing, Dark Mode and Interface Previews, just to name a few.\u00a0\nFrom his perspective, how can we best utilise SwiftUI?\nSwiftUI is built with speed in mind \u2013 It\u2019s beneficial to ingrain as much reusability as possible by breaking down UI into small components\nDiffing is in place when a state change occurs, which provides incredibly fast rendering\nSwiftUI has been made compatible with UIKit and Objective-C so one can start incorporating it into our apps (iOS 13 and above) from day one\nMore than anything, this event showcased a good number of live demos from our speakers, which captured audience interest to a great degree. We were in the presence of passionate, young folks, mostly freshers and professionals who were deeply involved in understanding the pros and cons of the latest technologies that have hit this operating system.\u00a0\nWe look forward to hosting more such events for our iOS community. For any queries or suggestions in relation to Huddle, do reach out to us at \nhuddle@zomato.com\n.\nAt Zomato, we are constantly on the lookout for iOS engineers who are passionate, love challenges and create reliable products.\u00a0\nIf you feel you\u2019re a fit for such a role, do go ahead and check \nthis\n out."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/architecture-behind-tags/",
        "author": "Abhinav Bhardwaj",
        "content": "Since Zomato\u2019s inception, our users have played an important role in helping people make informed decisions on what and where to eat.\u00a0\nWe now house reviews and photos for about a million listings on our platform and as a team, are constantly working to make this content easily creatable and consumable by all.\u00a0\nTo know more about how we made reviewing seamless for everyone, give our post on \nReviews 2.0 (Part 1)\n a read. Overall, the response has been overwhelming and we are witnessing a 35% \u2013 40% increase in reviews being posted month on month.\nIsn\u2019t that amazing?\nBelow are some essential details of the product we wanted to build \u2013\u00a0\n1. \nFor the reviewer \n\u2013 We wanted tags to be showcased to a reviewer at the time of review creation\u00a0\n2. \nFor the reader \u2013 \nWe wanted to showcase what each restaurant is known for or as we call this section \u2013\n \u201cRead what people are talking about\u201d\u00a0\nBut before we jump into the \u2018what\u2019 and \u2018how\u2019 of our implementation, let\u2019s have a look at the overall architecture of Reviews 2.0.\u00a0\nArchitecture of Reviews 2.0\nOur first step was to aggregate, what you can call a \n\u201cknowledge bank\u201d \u2013 \na corpus of all tags one could use in the dining and restaurant industry. From \n\u201ccomfortable seating\u201d\n to \n\u201cprompt service\u201d\n, our corpus incorporates a wide variety of tags. This is shown to reviewers when they wish to point out what they liked / didn\u2019t like about a particular restaurant. We named it Z-Tag Corpus.\u00a0\nAt the same time, we also wanted to design a system (an engine to process our reviews, to be specific), which provides insights into each restaurant by analyzing their reviews, taking into consideration the same corpus.\nHow did we create Z-Tag corpus?\nThe implementation aimed to summarize millions of reviews into broader tags, reflecting the mood and sentiment of our users.\u00a0\nWe used the \ngood ol\u2019 Python\n for all our NLP needs and data aggregation. The following libraries were ready at our disposal and were quite useful in tag creation \u2013\u00a0\nSpacy\n + \nNLTK\n \u2014 At Zomato\u2019s scale, we wanted a library equally powerful to process millions of reviews with the least dependencies and goodness of Cython. We went ahead with Spacy for stopwords removal, POS tagging, tokenization, lemmatization, dependency parsing and NER. Spacy\u2019s pipeline flow allowed us to focus on experiments whilst Spacy took care of performance for us. \nSentiWordNet\n and \nVaderSentiment Analyzer\n from NLTK gave us simple yet effective sentiment analysers.\n\u201cawesome food\u201d\n, \n\u201cincredible service\u201d\n, and \n\u201cpathetic staff\u201d\n were distinctly classified as having a positive or negative sentiment. Hence, NLTKs inbuilt libraries served as secondary, or one can say \nfallback classifiers\n.\nJellyfish\n, \nFuzzy Wuzzy\n \nand\n \nDifflib\n \u2014 These were utilised to create a map of correctly spelt words and their possibly misspelled substitutes. We also used them to detect highly similar strings.\nGensim\n \u2014 \nWe used Gensim for Topic modeling and its \nphraser\n module came in handy during phrase (collocation) extraction. We extracted bigrams and trigrams collocations that helped us in capturing the adjectives attached with an entity. \n\u201ccourteous staff\u201d\n,\n \nand\n \n\u201cquick service\u201d\n \nreally bring out the meaning in a context.\nFastText\n \u2014 It is important to realize that a word won\u2019t be of much use to us if we do not know the category to which it belongs. Does \n\u201clive music\u201d \nrepresent ambience? Does \n\u201ckid friendly\u201d\n represent service? We used Fasttext to classify the entities into various categories. This gave us more control over showcasing every aspect of a restaurant to our users.\nScikit-learn\n \n\u2014 It was our go-to library for modelling data, classification, clustering, etc. Scikit-learn made it possible to implement feature engineering through the wide range of algorithms it provides. Apart from various other use cases, it was also used for building a classifier to measure and classify the contextual sentiment for the extracted key topics.\u00a0\nRemarks like \n\u201c\ncourteous staff\n\u201d\n or \n\u201c\nmouth watering food\n\u201d \nare \npositive\n sentiments,\n \nwhile \n\u201c\npathetic service\n\u201d \nis\n \nnegative\n.\nHowever, certain mentions like \n\u201c\nlong waiting time..\n\u201d\n or \n\u201c\n..the food portions were less..\n\u201d, \nhave a \nneutral\n sentiment in a general sense, but in the restaurants or dining domain, they become contextually \npositive/negative\n sentiments.\nIn a restaurant review, users share their experience about several aspects of the visit \u2014 food, ambience, service, etc. As the number of reviews is not limited and each one mentions a different viewpoint, grasping the overall sense of these viewpoints from hundreds of reviews is cumbersome and time-consuming. We wanted to devise a way to make this decision making process faster.\u00a0\nTo answer this, we designed the section \u2014 \u201c\nRead what people are talking about\u201d\nThe approach we followed to get this right \u2013\u00a0\nWe mine opinions from reviews inspired by ABSA (Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis), which predicts the corresponding sentiment of an extracted aspect mentioned in the text documents.\nConsider this sentence for example \u2014 \n\u201cThe Chicken Whopper at Burger King was amazing but the service was slow\u201d\n. In this sentence, even though the overall sentiment is mixed, it clearly mentions two different aspects \u201c\nChicken Whopper\n\u201d and \u201c\nservice\n\u201d in \npositive\n and \nnegative\n connotations respectively.\nIn a syntactic grammar-based approach, a set of grammar rules are applied to the dataset to extract aspects. A syntactic grammar is defined with a clause and corresponding chunking rule, for example the \nVBG_DESCRIBING_NN_VV\n clause defines the following syntactic pattern:\nThis clause chunks the sentence when a verb (VB) describes the opinion on a target. For example, in the sentence \u201c\nThe place was awesome\n,\u201d the verb \nawesome\n is describing the opinion on target \nplace\n.\nHow ABSA works \u2013\u00a0\nWhen syntactic rule produces expected chunks:\n The snippet above shows chunking by the syntactic grammar clause- \nVBG_DESCRIBING_NN_VV\n. A relation extractor processes the chunked list of trees for the relationship between entities in the sentence. Though the syntactic approach is effective in parsing, it often suffers from noisy extraction.\nAs the coverage rules are increased, it eventually results in overlapping rules and hence noisy extraction. It is clear from the snippet below, that the same rule also interferes with a different sentence. Since the chunked part in the diagram below has no aspect opinion, it results in a noisy extraction.\nWhen syntactic rule produces unexpected chunks: \nThe particular syntactic rule was not expected to parse this sentence. It not only results in incorrect extraction but also blocks the other syntactic rule, which has resulted in precise extraction.\nTo address this problem, we proposed a hybrid of rule-based and machine learning models. The rule based model would extract the aspects and their opinion words, while the machine learning model learns the effectiveness of these rules with different sentence structures for a given corpus.\nFor training the model, a dataset is prepared with the sentence and aspect polarity extracted from each rule. A multi-label classifier is trained for syntactic rule prediction followed by relation extraction. This classifier allows us to select the suitable syntactic rule for parsing as the first step and reduces the noise extraction from other ineffective rules.\u00a0\nThe selection process is fully automated owing to our multi-label classifier.\nChallenges we faced\nFor an extracted entity to reach its final disposal in the product form, it must adhere to certain guidelines and business requirements in order to handle a varied set of audiences \u2013\u00a0\n\u2022 Quality entity extraction\u00a0\n\u2022 Contextual diversity\n\u2022 Personalization for maximum utility\nBringing such a model to production comes with key challenges \u2013\nFrequent Words\n \u2013 Some common words are widely used in reviews. Although useful, they cannot be helpful if found on every highlight presented. For example, even though the sentence \n\u201cThe food is amazing at Bellagio.\u201d\n, describes food, but it does not fit into our presentation form. A preferred entity is more specific, such as \u2018\nKung Pao Soup\u2019\n in \n\u201cKung Pao Soup served was mouth watering\u201d\n. It has been explicitly described and is a very specific dish, which qualifies as an entity for our use case. \nWe went ahead with an approach to find the frequency distribution of the words in our own corpus and selected the parent topic out of secondary ranked items using this frequency ranking.\nEntity Diversity\n \u2013 Showing multiple variations of a single dish (say \nPizza\n) will lead to a lack of diversity. A context-based selection of entity is conducted to incorporate for multiplicity. To achieve this objective, the extracted and classified topics are grouped on underlying intent, and a representative topic is chosen out of the group for conveying high level information.\nTime Decay Factor\n \u2013 By using an exponential time decay function, giving more weight to trending topics, we ensure that our implementation does not result in historical data.\nOur work on Reviews 2.0 opens doors for various relation extraction methods to be incorporated in order to minimize the noise. In an implicit aspect, there is an indirect indication of opinionated aspect. In the sentence \n\u201cThe place is quite expensive\u201d, \nthere is no clear mention of an aspect price, but \u201c\nexpensive\u201d\n indirectly indicates towards it. Currently, our system works only with explicit aspects. The immediate extension of this, can be to incorporate the implicit aspects as well.\u00a0\nAdditional efficient syntactic rules and relation extractors can also be included to enhance the process further. Post our launch, as a final step, we deployed web apps on a new subdomain behind an ELB and automated the entire production process using \nAnsible\n.\u00a0\nHave a look at our end product, it will surely blow your mind!\n\u201cThe chicken biryani served here is awesome. Really loved the vibrant decor. Their cheese nachos are worth dying for. I will definitely visit this place again.\u201d\nHappy reviewing!"

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "In more than 400 cities across India where Zomato operates, when you ask someone who has ordered food to name the app or website they use, the answer is \nZomato\n. While \nlaunching new cities is hard work\n, it is extremely rewarding in multiple ways. \nToday, we are present in 556 Indian cities and towns. In more than 400 of these, we have virtually gone door-to-door helping users understand what food delivery means and how they can use the Zomato app for their family. Our delivery partners have also been on-the-ground moving the food delivery experience a step further each day.\nThe response that we have seen from the so called \u201cTier 2-4\u201d cities in India has been a pleasant surprise for us. I want to present the Zomato story to you \u2013 what we saw in the last few months of frenetic expansion of our food delivery service to the real India. The India where most of us come from \u2013\u00a0no matter which city we live in now.\nI met someone recently; someone I respect for his views on markets and companies. He told me that it is companies, not countries, that deliver returns in emerging markets. I am going to go a step further, and say that a slow economy (if at all it is slow) is the best time to innovate, create irreplaceable value for customers, and get the money exchanging hands again.\nHere\u2019s what we saw in the Real India \u2013 \nTrivandrum (Kerala) became our 50th city in November of 2018 and before the end of 2018, Jamnagar (Gujarat) became our 100th city. By the summer of 2019, we reached our 200th city (Solan, Himachal). In June of 2019, we reached another milestone with Jalpaiguri (West Bengal) becoming \nour 300th city\n. A month later, we had already established our flag in our 400th city \u2013 Chittoor (Andhra Pradesh), quickly followed by \nour 500th city\n in Leh. Apart from being the first to introduce large scale food delivery in NE India, we are also uninterruptedly active in 10 cities (Guwahati, Nagaon, Jorhat, Agartala, Silchar, Dibrugarh, Tezpur, Shillong, Tinsukia and Aizawl) in the region.\u00a0\nAll these cities (and counting) prove \u2013 more than anything else \u2013 India\u2019s growing appetite for services which add tangible values to people\u2019s lives.\nTier 3 and 4 cities now contribute 35% of the monthly order volume. These cities are relatively small but are growing at a frenetic pace. A majority of the launches across the smaller cities reached the initial 1000-orders-a-day milestone within a few weeks, if not days.\nThere are no delivery zones in most of these towns \u2013 we deliver from any restaurant to anywhere in these towns.\nDelivery times are 3 minutes less than the larger cities \u2013 most of it because of lack of traffic.\nOut of our committed delivery partner network in non-metro cities, 20% \nare on bicycles\n. This is in tune with our commitment to generating employment as well as addressing environmental concerns.\u00a0\nAbility to hire in these markets is high. Operating costs are lower. CACs (Customer Acquisition Cost) are negligible.\nWhile average order value is lower in non-metro cities by 20%, the cost of delivery is lower by 50% making the economics superior as compared to the metro cities. By all measures, our delivery business economics in non-metro cities is superior to metro cities.\nThis is all to say that while we understand that the delivery business across India is a long game, the development and growth of these smaller cities belie popular stereotypes about these cities.\u00a0\nZomato is a household name today and not just in the larger cities but also in the most obscure geographies in India. People from these places \nidentify food delivery with the colour red\n. So much so, that someone in Punjab also made a very \ncatchy song\n about Zomato. Spoiler alert \u2013 the song is really good. (Also, on the record, we have nothing to do with the creation of this song \u2013 we just stumbled across this ourselves last night).\nAreas of growth \u2013\nThe smaller diameters in the non-metro cities allow for greater orders per restaurant. Meituan, a delivery app in China services 22 million orders a day from 5 million restaurants. A rough average calculation amounts to 4.4 orders per restaurant per day. In India, on the other hand, the capacity utilization is much more aggressive \u2013 Zomato delivers 1.3 m orders a day from 150k restaurants across India at more than 10 orders per restaurant per day. \nThis underlines the huge delivery opportunity of cloud kitchens and its ability to service users heavily across tight geographies in a planned manner. We are committed to developing cloud kitchens across these geographies to bridge the supply gap. In the same breath, I want to re-emphasise that we will \nnever\n compete with our restaurateur partners \u2013 we will only build the kitchens \u2013 but they will be operated by restaurant brands. Our kitchens are operational in 50 cities across India, with 110 kitchen hubs (either completed or under construction). In total, there are 663 kitchen units and kiosks. \nOver the next few years, we estimate our food delivery business to grow to numbers we would be labelled as stupid for saying out loud. We think there are about 200m people in India who will order food from Zomato about 5 times a month, with the top 20m cohort amongst these ordering more than once a day, every day. \nThese 200m people (and in some time, many more than that) are the real India. And that India is coming of age. Domestic consumption in India is what it is \u2013 and it is going to grow as it is. However, India is a market which is unique \u2013 here, companies that innovate and adapt will earn the right to serve the millions of India. The market won\u2019t flock to any product or a service just because."

        "content": "Cooking oil is the backbone of our industry \u2013 and when not used wisely, a notorious culprit in several health issues. Almost everything we eat uses edible oils and thus, the potential effect on food quality (read: your health) is extremely high. \nWell, that\u2019s where and how we come into the picture.\nBefore we get into details, let us give credit where it\u2019s due. The Government took the leap with an initiative wherein the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas joined forces with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to introduce what they called \nRUCO (Repurpose Used Cooking Oil)\n. \nSpearheaded by FSSAI\n, RUCO targets two outcomes at the same time \u2013 ensure responsible usage and disposal of edible oil in commercial kitchens (thereby avoiding several life-threatening diseases), and reduce our country\u2019s dependence on crude oil imports by repurposing waste edible oil.\u00a0 \nWe are well positioned to act as an enabler for Used Cooking Oil (UCO) aggregation across the country. HoReCa (Hotel/Restaurant/Caf\u00e9) segment consumes almost 30% of total cooking oil of the country, and we are keen on leveraging our reach, supply chain and technology expertise to bring scale to this fantastic initiative. We are already putting our reach (on both FBO side and the customer side) to good use by raising awareness and incentivizing responsible food habits in the industry and UCO initiative aligns well with our core mission: \nbetter food for more people\n. We hope to witness zero oil adulteration and responsible use of oil. \nBut there is much more to this development. And we are happy to introduce the work that we are presently doing to \nused cooking oil (UCO)\n.\nHere\u2019s how \u2013\u00a0\nTo put it succinctly, cooking oil after it has served its lifetime in the kitchen can be converted into biodiesel. Food businesses, by design, are supposed to not overuse oil and discard it for industrial purpose after an FSSAI specified usage. RUCO initiative brings about the right regulatory framework to ensure that the used cooking oil is discarded before it becomes a health hazard, and does not find its way into second-hand markets (yes, you read it right; there is a large second-hand market for used oil \u2013 which is why, think of cooking oil when you indulge in your favorite samosa next time).\nHowever, aggregation of UCO from thousands of food businesses remains a key bottleneck in this initiative. Traceability is the next big challenge. After all, when and how does the oil move from the restaurant to the point of end-use? Being a waste product, it exchanges several hands, which blurs the accountability of responsible disposal. Add to that the thin economics of wastage management \u2013 and we end up with an extremely complex operating environment.\nHere\u2019s a sneak-peek into how we do it:\nThis approach not only solves for the major problems for two large industries (health and petroleum) in the country but also creates a lot of synergistic environmental effects \u2013 by replacement of conventional diesel with environment-friendly biodiesel. Partner restaurants signing up with us will be issued a certificate of compliance with FSSAI framework. The certificate will be a testimony of organised traceability on the end-use of UCO and its responsible disposal.\nWe have already made some progress and UCO will be procured from 1000 kitchens in Delhi NCR this month. The collection drive will spread to five cities in India by next month (November) and we intend to scale up rapidly from there. We have partnered with one of the largest biodiesel manufacturers in the country \u2013 BioD Energy, and we will work closely with BioD to achieve scale as quickly as possible. The Government needs approximately 5 million tons of UCO per year by 2030 (for 5% Biodiesel blending targets) \u2013 and that\u2019s the benchmark we are using to determine our own targets.\nIt\u2019s an audacious goal given the massive procurement targets but we are proud to be working towards this cause \u2013 putting our weight behind the initiative \u2013 and leveraging our reach and capabilities to include as many partner restaurants as possible.\u00a0\nStay tuned for more updates on the UCO initiative and feel free to reach out to us with your queries at \nsustainability@zomato.com"

        "content": "Click here to download the PDF version of this report.\n\u201cOne of the nicest things about life is the way we must regularly stop whatever it is we are doing and devote our attention to eating.\u201d \u2013 Unknown\nWe celebrated our 11th anniversary on the 10th of July. Continuing the tradition we started last year, we marked it by sharing meals with the underprivileged in our communities. Thousands of Zomans and Feeding India Hunger Heroes distributed over 100,000 healthy and hygienic meals across 11 countries.\nOur company-wide Town Hall on the same day was made extra special because some of our highest performing delivery partners joined us with their families, to share their stories. It was humbling to hear how transformative financial independence has been for our delivery partners; and how Zomato has impacted their lives. \nEvery anniversary makes us proud of what we have achieved yet, acutely aware of how much there is left to do. Overall, we feel lucky and grateful to be building a business in the world of food. The impact we can make is humungous, and there is so much to do to further our vision of \u2018better food for more people\u2019.\u00a0\nThe quality of our business has come a long way in the last six months, and we are proud to share the results with you.\nBusiness Performance\nIn the last six months, we had put two audacious goals ahead of us, and worked our strategy and execution backwards from there. We said we will shoot for market leadership, and simultaneously steer the business towards a more sustainable P&L.\nLet\u2019s dive into the three business segments that we operate in \u2013\u00a0\u2028\nFood Delivery 2. Dining Out and 3. Sustainability.\nFood Delivery\n\u201cWho earns more, a fresher at a software services company, or a food delivery agent?\u201d \u2013 a recent question on Quora\nThe food delivery business surprises us every day. Each time that we think we have reached a new peak, we find yet another one to conquer.\u00a0In April \u201819, we were in 200 cities. Today, we offer our food delivery service in over 500 cities across India, and are contribution margin positive across the country.\nOur order volumes in top 15 cities have doubled in the last 12 months; while the remaining cities already contribute 35% to our order volumes. \nOur food@work business is growing well, and some very large accounts are slated to go live soon. We are already doing ~3m orders a month for food@work (this is in addition to the orders reported in the chart above).\nWe are very excited to change the paradigm of food, as we continue to let every town in India get a taste of Zomato.\nWe expect the trends across all these charts to continue looking better in the future.\nOur delivery partners are the backbone of our operations. Their hard work and determination is what drives this sector forward, and we are proud to be working  with 200k+ delivery partners \u2013 to create an unprecedented number of jobs, and  social impact.\nAreas of urgent concern in the food delivery business \u2013\nAs our order volumes go up, the amount of plastic packaging waste we generate goes up proportionally. We will put in a coordinated effort to reduce/eliminate the use of plastic in deliveries made by Zomato and lower our carbon footprint significantly.\nDining Out\n\u201cTogether, we can help make sure that every family that walks into a restaurant can make an easy, healthy choice.\u201d \u2013 Michelle Obama\nAll our services \u2013 listings, reviews, and table reservations are geared towards finding new experiences and making them yours. \nThe number of restaurant listings globally on Zomato has grown from 1.2m in Sep 2018 to 1.5m in Sep 2019. Half of this increase comes from India alone \u2013 this huge increase is testament to the pace at which restaurants are mushrooming all over India, and grabbing share from home kitchens. \nTable reservations \u2013 we\u2019ve grown from 800k booked covers in Jan 2019 to 1.3m+ booked covers in Sep 2019 \u2013 organically and with zero investment.\nGold takes the Zomato experience one notch further \u2013 from discovery to loyalty.  We now have 1.4m members world wide on Zomato Gold; who are using their  privileges more than thrice a month. Gold is a niche, but large loyalty program. Having said that, so far, less than 5% restaurants participate in Zomato Gold, and less than 5% of our MAUs are Gold members. There\u2019s so much headroom to grow here.\nFrom a restaurateur point of view, Gold is not for everyone. We always encourage restaurants to\n determine if participating in Zomato Gold makes commercial sense for them. Some restaurant\n owners in India campaigned against Zomato Gold last month (#logout campaign); we engaged with the restaurant owner community and rolled out\n some changes to the program that were widely accepted by most restaurants, as well as users \u2013\n thus creating more balance in the program. A\n number of restaurants who have returned to\n Zomato Gold post these changes have seen a\n 100% increase in revenue.\nAt the start of the \u2018logout\u2019 campaign, we had ~6,100 restaurants in India on Zomato Gold (for Dining Out); as of today, we have ~6,300 restaurants in India on Gold (for Dining Out). In addition to that, we have 10,000 restaurants that are participating in recently launched Zomato Gold for delivery (more on how successful this has been in a few weeks). The number of restaurants participating in Gold outside of India stands at 6,500.\nA third party report (by Redseer) validated much of our belief in Gold. The report shows that \u2013\n \u2022 90% of Zomato Gold members try out new restaurants because of the\n program, thus leading to new trials for participating restaurants\n \u2022 Gold increases the total size of the restaurant industry. The frequency of\n dining out for Gold members has increased from 2.8 to 3.3 times/month post Gold membership\n The survey also showed that the impact on restaurants has been positive \u2013\n \u2022 Gold Partners have witnessed ~35% average growth in bill volumes after\n partnering with Zomato Gold\n \u2022 Partners report a marked increase in net profit due to increased utilisation\nSustainability\n\u201cYou are what you eat eats.\u201d \u2013 Michael Pollan (In Defense of Food)\nWe set up Hyperpure to not only provide fresh and clean ingredients to our restaurant partners, but to also reduce wastage and inefficiencies in the supply chain. \nIn the past six months, we have successfully executed over 65,000 orders for 2,200 restaurants across Delhi and Bengaluru. On an average restaurants place 5-7orders every month, with an average order value of $100. \nOur revenue from \nHyperpure\n for H1 stands at $6.5m (compared to zero in H1 FY19) with a hearty FY20 projection (10x growth\ud83c\udf32).\nNEW\n \u2013 In July, we started collecting \nused cooking oil (UCO)\n from restaurants, processing it in our facilities and delivering it to biodiesel manufacturing facilities. The fuel thus created, emits 75 per cent less carbon than diesel/petrol. We collect ~130 tonnes of used oil per month, from 1000+ kitchens in Delhi NCR, and will expand operations to five more cities this October. We expect this to grow very fast, create a lot of positive environmental impact, and be a significant contributor to the Indian government\u2019s goals for bio-diesel production.\nThis January, Zomato and \nFeeding India\n\u2018s association gave birth to The Feeding Foundation \u2013 moving from a primarily philanthropic relationship to a deeply collaborative alliance. While Feeding India continues to remain a non profit \u2013 managing their own finances, data, infrastructure and strategy; Zomato\u2019s expertise in consumer tech and deep understanding of the food ecosystem will play a key part in the Feeding Foundation\u2019s goal of designing interventions to eliminate hunger and food wastage globally.\nFeeding India distributed 78,300 monthly meals to the underprivileged in the first month of this year. This figure has now skyrocketed to over \n1.6m meals a month in September 2019\n. Feeding India now has 22,500+ volunteers in 95 cities, up from 8,500 volunteers in 54 cities in Jan \u201919.\nPeople\nIn the last few months, we are proud to have undertaken industry leading initiatives including, but not limited to \u2013\nPaathshala\n \nOur initiative \u092a\u093e\u0920\u0936\u093e\u0932\u093e, began with a simple thought \u2013 create possibilities for the children of our delivery partners to invent and discover a better future. We want every one of them to adapt to a mindset of \u2018I can\u2019 by enabling them with right skills, securing them with knowledge and empowering them towards a sustainable future. We now have about 100 children across seven cities in India who attend Paathshala every Sunday.\nParental Leave Policy\nThe first few months of parenting are a challenging time as life changes, financial pressure mounts and sleep departs. Work pressure should not be an additional burden. That is why we give 26 weeks paid leave to all new parents (men and women), so that they can enjoy the new gift of life and love. We also provide a $1000 endowment to new parents to get them off to the best start. \nPradyot (VP Product) and his wife Himanie with their new-born-twins \u2013 Abeer (means \u2018strong\u2019) and Tahaan (means \u2018merciful\u2019). He is able to do his equal part in helping take care of their twins without any pressure of showing up at work, while making sure that his team doesn\u2019t drop any balls at work\n.\nProbation and notice periods\nWe do not have probation or notice periods at Zomato. We are a company of people connected by relationships, built on trust. No policies will save a failed relationship or change an inevitable outcome of broken trust. By removing these policies our teams focus on working together and finding constructive ways to \u201cwork it out\u201d and build mutual respect, rather than fall back on policies. \nLaunching the Founder Program at Zomato\nWhat does a \u2018founder\u2019 mean? According to me, it just means that you have now earned the leadership team\u2019s trust to be able to take decisions on behalf of the company. Simple, but not easy. This year, we announced Gaurav Gupta (aka GG) as a Founder of Zomato. And when that happened, some people asked me \u2013 \u201cI like GG, but how did you decide that he should now be called a founder?\u201d\nOver time, after speaking to, hearing from, and reading about other founders, I have developed a set of founder \u2018values\u2019 that I think are necessary for someone to be a good founder \u2013\nCommitment\n \u2013 you realise that as a founder, your commitment is not only to the role you play, but to the vision and mission you share with thousands of people who work with you everyday. You value the opportunity to serve millions of people, and the responsibility that comes with being a founder. You deeply understand the commitment and sacrifices it requires to live up to the responsibility.\nResilience\n \u2013 when we are rejected, the door before us becomes a wall. We can either push against the wall pretending it\u2019s a door and tell ourselves those who rejected us made a mistake. Or cry on the wall, bemoaning our lack of talent. Or try to scale the wall, realising it is unyielding. Or we can walk away and look for another door. A founder finds other doors. Those new doors mean resilience. When you address uncertainty with flexibility, you exhibit resilience.\nCulture driver \n\u2013 you are an embodiment and evangelist for the company\u2019s culture and values, both within the company and externally \u2014 to employees, customers and business partners.\nSunshine test \n\u2013 you are mindful of the sunshine test \u2013 i.e. everything you do should be able to stand public scrutiny. \nMore hits than misses\n \u2013 founders have strong business and people instincts and make decisions that are mostly right.\nPeople first\n \u2013 you prioritise your actions along the interests of the community of employees, consumers and business partners.\nHigh standards \n\u2013 you uphold the highest standards for quality of work for yourself and your teams. You stay connected to details, and only have tolerance for well-intended mistakes.\nPersonal mastery\n \u2013 you have a learning mindset, are intellectually honest, and are open to new ideas and change. You proactively seek feedback, take everything positively, and invest in your own learning and growth.\nEye for talent\n \u2013 you not only have the ability to hire people better than yourself, but also invest in converting people\u2019s capabilities into their abilities. You bet on exceptional talent, irrespective of their age and experience and put these people at the right places where they can add the most amount of value.\nGo wide, and deep \n\u2013 founders have a reasonable amount of meaningful input for each aspect of the business; and when required, founders can quickly master any topic that they need to (irrespective of whether they like that topic or not).\nSelf confidence\n \u2013 founders are fearless and comfortable to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree. They do not submit to authority and operate from deep-rooted, mission-oriented convictions.\nAmbition\n \u2013 you create and communicate a bold direction that inspires extraordinary action. Then you inspire people to execute and beat these goals.\nHumility\n \u2013 you look into the mirror and take ownership for negative outcomes, whereas you look out of the window and give credit to those responsible for positive ones.\nPrudence\n \u2013 you do more with less and maximise the output of your own and your team\u2019s work, while keeping budgets and costs as low as possible.\nSource of energy\n \u2013 a founder is a source of energy for everyone around them. Founders have to energise, and build morale around lots of stakeholders. They know that if they are drained of energy, then other people around them will also feel drained.\nIgnorance\n \u2013 founders are blindly ignorant to the challenges around the problems they\u2019re seeking to solve. That means they think outside the box and are undeterred by the failings of those who have tried before them.\nThis is not an exhaustive list and I can add more points to it, but in my opinion, these are the most important aspects of being in a founder\u2019s mindset. If you zoom out and look at this list, operating with a founder\u2019s mindset is simple, but not easy. It just needs you to detach from yourself, and bring your soul to work. Also, it is not necessary that you are in the founder\u2019s mindset everyday; what\u2019s important is whether the days you are in the founder\u2019s mindset are significantly more than the days you are not.\nCreating the Founder Program\n \u2013 we formalised a program where people who have contributed to Zomato deeply; have built/scaled businesses, and have consistently demonstrated a founder\u2019s mindset for a reasonable period of time, are acknowledged for their passion, commitment and perseverance. They should have the ability, and our trust to take decisions on behalf of the company. Every year, we will assess and announce deserving individuals as founders at Zomato. Being a founder gives you the privilege of serving our employees, our customers and our business partners from the highest possible level. It is a privilege to play a cornerstone role in building out our ambitious vision \u2013 \u2018better food for\n more people\u2019.\nAll growth begins with discomfort. Without it, there is no reason to change. We mature when we finally realise that life is not about achieving absolute peace but about effectively managing tension.\nUntil next time,\nDeepinder"

        "content": "A couple of months ago, we \nintroduced LGBTQIA tags\n for restaurants to help drive a change in mind-set. While we hoped for a time when the tag would be redundant, we committed ourselves to constantly signalling change. This particular decision was in line with our core values \u2013 there should be no place for prejudice and intolerance in our society whether it\u2019s inside the workplace or a restaurant. Further, our ecosystem is so rich in diversity \u2013 users, restaurants and delivery partners \u2013 that we simply can\u2019t make any distinctions based on prejudice or bias. \nWe can see that the introduction of LGBTQIA tags is already playing a useful role for users and are helping restaurants. Three months later, as promised, we reached out to restaurants again to see if they would carry the tag and we have been overwhelmed by the response. \nCompared to May, there has been a 106% uptick in the number of restaurants wanting to carry the tag \u2013 totaling closer to 1000 restaurants \u2013\u00a0 that are proudly displaying the welcoming tags on their Zomato pages. They are currently active in 7 cities in India (NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Pune) and there are plans to extend this development to other cities as well.\u00a0\nFortunately, the beauty of our marketplace is that any establishment that fulfills set criteria can list itself on Zomato. Similarly, anyone can order and anyone can deliver your order. While there are checks and balances designed for neutrality, the core is democratic. This setting allows a rather free movement of food, restaurant types and every kind of user. \nAgain, we are truly overwhelmed by the tremendous response we\u2019ve received from early adopters of the program. We will keep reaching out to the restaurant community to expand this base."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/reviews-2-0/",
        "author": "Aman Priyadarshi",
        "content": "In our last \nannual report\n, we talked about how deeply we care about \u201cbetter food for more people\u201d and how it is the very DNA for everything we do here at Zomato. \nThat\u2019s exactly where Zomato started out \u2014 a platform to discover restaurants which had good reviews so that you can have a great experience. Whether food quality, ambience, cost, service or even the crowd that walk into their outlets \u2014 restaurant owners received 360 degree feedback from users. Outlets which worked to improve their critical reviews saw their rating go up and in return drew more business. On the other hand, customers were happy being able to choose better places (with higher ratings) to go to. Win-win.\nA decade later \u2014 we have over 25m reviews and 52m photos for about a million restaurants listed on Zomato across the world. This makes us one of the largest food discovery platforms in the world. But here\u2019s the catch \u2014 all these reviews were written by only 1% of our monthly active users (MAUs) on Zomato. Which means that for every 100 users who use Zomato to consume reviews, only 1 user writes a review. \nOver the next 10 years, we want a lot more users to write reviews and share their perspective with the large community that we have built.\nReinventing Reviews, but where do we start?\nIf there\u2019s a demand, supply follows. So, we went back to our users who solved it for us. \nWe asked people why didn\u2019t they read as many reviews and here\u2019s what we found \u2013 \nClearly, our current supply of reviews didn\u2019t adhere to the evolved demand. To make people read reviews, we had to make reviews crisper than they currently were.\nNow that we had a better understanding of what kind of reviews people want to read, we still didn\u2019t know what was stopping people from writing more reviews. Hence, we asked our users what kept them from writing reviews frequently?\nWith this, our takeaway was ready.\nPresent reviews in a short and crisp manner so that they are easy to consume\nHelp people to write great reviews with less effort\nHow did we design our solutions?\nOur designers are some of the best in town. Given a problem, they come up with great answers in high fidelity. \nThis is what they conjured up after multiple iterations \u2013 \nThe 5 tags under \u201cwhat do people say about this place\u201d have been parsed out of 1091 reviews that we have received for this place. Would you believe that you read over 1091 reviews for an outlet in the image above? You really did!\nOur user testing showed that users loved this format of summarising the content of reviews in form of tags for them; so we thought that we should introduce this new content currency of tags to the creation of reviews.\nIn Reviews 2.0, you don\u2019t have to be a pro reviewer to write good reviews. You can now add a very helpful review on Zomato in under 30 seconds. \nYou can choose to not write a long-form text review. You can simply tap on a suggested tag or add a new one. Thus a good quality yet crisp review can be written in a breeze!\nNow that we had solved for both creation and consumption of reviews at a design level, it was time for our engineering team to take it to the finish line.\n How did we develop Reviews 2.0?\nTruth be told, the perfect user experience had compelling engineering and data challenges before Reviews 2.0 could see the light of the day. Here were the top problems we had to solve for \u2013\n Challenges for \u2018Create Review\u2019 \u2013\nWe would need a library of tags to save users time while writing reviews (tapping is faster than typing + it wouldn\u2019t require a second moderation so does away with spelling mistakes) \nIn order to support good quality review creation, the suggested tags would have to be relevant to that outlet\n Challenges for \u2018Read Review\u2019 \u2013\nHow would we show tags on the restaurant page on day 0?\nHow would we make review tags backward compatible with our existing reviews?\nWe worked on multiple strategies, using solutions across data aggregation and machine learning models to solve for the above challenges \u2014 you can read all about it in our next post on Reviews 2.0 (coming up soon).\nHow are Reviews 2.0 performing?\nAt 30% app adoption, Reviews 2.0 already contribute 60% of our daily reviews and are projected to increase the rate of review creation by 100% overall (win!).\nMoving forward, Reviews 2.0 opens a lot of avenues for our platform such as \u2013\nBetter search \u2013 Search anything on Zomato, not just cuisine, dish or restaurant name. You will soon be able to search experiences \u2013 \u2018perfect for conversation\u2019 or \u2018great for family dinner\u2019\nEnable match % \u2013 Predict if a user will like or not like a place even if the user has never been there\nHave you tried writing a Review 2.0 on Zomato yet? If not, do download the latest version of the \napp\n from the app store and give it a spin."

Over the years, we have put in significant effort in building a distinctive visual signature for Zomato while building a deep connect with food. Today, we believe, a message from Zomato should be identifiable even without the wordmark.\nAs we were designing the\n new sushi design system\n we began wondering \u2013 how would you recognize Zomato if the \u2018visual\u2019 part was missing? Digital payments, behind the screen updates, voice enabled transactions \u2013 after all, the future is increasingly going to be sonic. In other words, what could Zomato sound like?\nThis question led us to ponder the aural part of our identity. Between white noise and the non-distinct beep-s and buzz-es, we sensed an immense opportunity to create an auditory palette to represent Zomato. A rather unique tune which would encapsulate both what Zomato stands for as a brand, and how millions of our partners and consumers feel while interacting with us.\nTo accomplish this goal, we roped in \nBrand Musiq\n, a dedicated sonic-branding agency for the task. Dipak Marwah and Rajeev Raja blended together the craftsmanship of savant-esque musicians with wisdom of grey-haired admen. A month of literal fine-tuning later, we are finally ready to jive to Zomato\u2019s signature track, which is distinct and hummable.\nIt captures the excitement as well as the anticipation of a food delivery as well as the reassurance of a Gold unlock. The \nZomato Originals\n brand in every video beats to this excitement too. This short yet riveting arrangement can now be heard on \nthe latest Zomato app update (v14)\n. Longer versions and adaptations of our mogo (musical logo) will soon feature in our audio-visual communications as we fully integrate our sonic identity. If you have enthu Zomans as friends, you\u2019ll be hearing them flaunt the 20-second ringtone too.\nGo ahead. Give it a listen. Sound on!"

Even if \u2018binge-watching\u2019 is a recent phenomenon, the classic TV Dinner is decades old.

This presents the perfect opportunity to discover our video food streams that will make them laugh, learn and come back for more.\n \nSo, we thought, why not jump right in and redefine a food prime time?\nStarting Monday (16th September), Zomato will launch 18 Original Shows over the course of the next three months. Available in an all-new \u201cVideos\u201d tab in the Zomato app, videos will be categorized by genre letting users watch 3-15 minute videos across shows, recipes and Sneak Peek restaurant stories. The Zomato video experience will launch with 2000+ videos that include Zomato Originals, which will be available to stream in India, while Sneak Peek and recipe videos can be accessed anywhere in the world.\nAll Zomato Original shows are around food but with a twist. Comedy, reality, fiction, advice, celebrity interviews will explore food in unique, engaging and entertaining videos.\nCheck out some of the binge-worthy pairings:\nCatch the trailer \nhere\n. \nFood and You with Sanjeev Kapoor\n \u2013 You know him as India\u2019s best-known Chef.

Watch who wins in this gut-splittingly funny segment.\nWe\u2019ve combined all things food with binge-worthy genres and came up with a diverse slate of shows. With shows and videos in both English and Hindi, we hope every corner of India will tune in to Zomato.\nAll episodes are bite-sized, between 3 and 15 minutes.

Our engineering and design teams have worked closely over the past weeks to elevate these experiences for you.\nAs a result, our latest app update built on the foundation of our new design system \u2013 \nSushi\n, is out for you and we are nothing but proud to fruition some really cool features this time around.\u00a0\nHere are some of the key highlights from this update \u2013\nOne search fits all \nThe Search bar is now placed at the top and will help you begin discovery at any point in time. Also, when you initiate a search, you\u2019ll get contextual search options. Going forward, wherever you are on the app, you are just a click away from starting a new search all over again.\nSorted and how\u00a0\u00a0\nExpect more visibility as far as search is concerned. You can not only toggle easily (read: faster) but also customize your search to get more accurate search results. Moreover, the number of filters have gone up, thus smoothing the whole process \u2013 we\u2019ve introduced the most commonly used filters right above your search results for easy access. \nAll answers under one umbrella\nEarlier, different versions of a restaurant page used to exist for delivery and dine out \u2013 the app used to reflect our organisational structure more than what a user truly needs. In this release, we have merged all your different information needs (Ratings, Reviews, Menus, Delivery, Gold, Table Reservations) under a single easy to use restaurant storefront page on the Zomato app. You can initiate any and every user action from this single page, without having to play ping pong.\nFastest way to review now \nReviews play a major part in ensuring the neutrality of the Zomato platform. With this update, you can now write about food, service, ambience, cost and crowd in less than 30 seconds. You will now be able to write more nuanced reviews, thanks to the introduction of tags which will not only help compose a more informative review but will also help in deciding which restaurant to dine at or order from. Needless to add, writing a review has never been easier on our app. The information that we glean from such structured reviews will also help us create a more wholesome search and discovery experience for you.\nBrand new profile\u00a0\u00a0\nSimilarly, the profile page has gone completely clutter-free with an all new look to boot. Your profile will now reflect everything about \nyou\n and gives you an option to add a cover \u2013 based on your personality and mood \u2013 from a wide variety of images provided by Zomato.\nMind your language\u00a0\nWith operations in 500 cities in India and 10,000+ cities across the world \u2013 Language is becoming a key focus area at Zomato. You won\u2019t have to change your device language setting to a preferred language anymore to switch the language in the Zomato app. You can now enjoy a separate language setting built exclusively for the Zomato app irrespective of your device languages. Both these settings can co-exist independently.\nWho doesn\u2019t like nightlife?\nAcross several cities in India and the world, \u201cnightlife\u201d is a key reason for many us dine out. We have now separated this into a distinct experience such that you might get access to bars and pubs offering the best around you.\u00a0\nOn the visual front\u00a0\nWe have a tonne of new and exciting video content for you \u2013 the visual goodness of Sneak peek, that brings the visual richness of restaurants to your phone. Also, when you are viewing videos, the app automatically and obviously switches over to dark mode (which btw, will be available for the entire app very soon).\nVox populi\u00a0\nWe\u2019ve received encouraging responses on social media from our users. Most have loved the change while some have shared constructive criticism as well.\u00a0\nThat was all from our side on the new update, can\u2019t wait for you to try it out and experience what we have built for you. Do write to us with your feedback on the new app at feedback@zomato.com \u2013 we are listening."

        "content": "Around September 2018, having more than a couple of years of experience in early stage startups, I was on the lookout for a change. I decided to search for a \u2018well established and structured\u2019 organisation as my next destination, where I could constantly develop my skills.\u00a0\nWhat does a \u2018well established and structured\u2019 organisation really mean? For me, it has always meant the quality of and the constant flow of work that I may get to do. Specifically speaking, my interest solely lies in the tech stack each organisation works upon and how this is utilised to make functions extensible, on a daily basis.\u00a0\nHaving heard of some not-so-great reviews about Zomato, I was initially not even considering it as an option. However, what motivated me to join this organisation was the type of work I was promised, and more than that, the fact that I was going to receive as much responsibility as my male counterparts. I know how this sounds \u2013 extremely old school and redundant \u2013 but the opposite of this was true for my previous organisations and this was the hard reality that I had initially decided to live with. \nNot anymore.\u00a0\nZomato changed this for me. What I perceived as being unstructured or problematic here, were actually opportunities that I just had to pick up and develop. I was offered to work on and grow in services I never thought I would be associated with.\nTo make this even better, I was being offered a chance to work with a team which was responsible to build microservices from scratch, which meant that there were no limitations to the type of tech stack one could expose themselves to \u2013 we could simply make the call according to the requirements of a particular service at any given time. \nHustle and then some more\nOn my very first day, the hustle and work quickly seeped into my routine. I had to swiftly learn Golang and Javascript and was asked to make modifications to our notification service, which I had no experience in before. If I could do this in just one day \u2013 I wanted to test myself and see what I could achieve going forward. At this moment, I decided to be a part of Zomato for good. \nIt\u2019s incredible how your opportunities here are not limited to your previous experience but to your ability and interest to learn and imbibe new concepts.\u00a0\nCut to a year later: I have received the opportunity to work on even more challenging tasks and have gotten to learn and collaborate with some of the smartest and most dedicated folks here. I have worked on various projects in relation to our notification service, location service, open-tracing, profile store service, database splitter, jumbo kafka wrapper and much more. In this short span of time I have been trusted with the complete ownership of tasks undertaken by me, starting from designing the architecture, researching about the best stack available to do the job and finally to deploying and monitoring them independently. The scale at which each of these services are operating today is amazing and definitely gives you a high sense of responsibility. \nWhen one gets to witness the amount of impact your small piece of code is making to its users, you realise you don\u2019t want to stop.\nCurrently, I am involved with the formulation of a profile store service and this is surely one of the most challenging projects for me until now. A profile store is a database that is home to a wide range of data sets and is broken down at a restaurant, user and dish level. In simple terms, it stores the current, historical and derived data, combined with behavioural attributes of a particular entity \n(dish, user, restaurant)\n. On a daily basis, I work towards maintaining this system and ensure that it continues to enhance Zomato as a platform and engage our user base in the most effective way possible.\nOver time and with the experience I have been able to gain here, I am able to apply my learning to everything on a real-time basis. I have now been conditioned to think and question every aspect in a different manner \u2013 mainly to ensure we\u2019re utilising the best practices and are keeping the code base structured enough to maintain its usability for future features and developers.\nGoing forward, I know I have a lot to execute and accomplish here, especially when it comes to the services we are looking to improve upon. What\u2019s great about such a setup is that there is no dearth of problem statements that are to be picked up and tackled; one just needs to have the zeal and passion to work towards solving them in the best possible manner."

The impact of the floods left many families without food and water; the loss of livelihood; as well as the loss of their loved ones. Thirty-three districts in Assam and 12 districts in Bihar were severely affected by the deluge \u2013 directly affecting over 4 million people.\u00a0\nTo help in any and every way possible, \nFeeding India\n along with Zomato \ninitiated a relief fund\n in July 2019.\nThrough our #techforgood initiative, \nZomato\u2019s users contributed \u20b954,70,100\n, which was used to prepare relief packs of all essential necessities along with food, water, medicines, torches, mosquito coils and clothes for small and large families. Across both the states, Feeding India volunteers (known as \u2018Hunger Heroes\u2019) have been working on-the-ground conducting relief camps and \nhelped around 43,000+ people so far, serving 2,33,150 meals till date.\nStarting in July and through August, successful donation drives have been conducted in six villages across East Champaran and Muzaffarpur, Bihar. Led by our Patna Feeding India city leader Aman Singh, with six other Hunger Heroes \u2013 we distributed 500+ relief packs and food, helping 2500+ people in need.\u00a0\nIn Assam, 9 successful drives have been conducted across 20+ villages.

        "author": "Vijay Verma",
        "content": "\u201cThe effort required to build a design system is tiny compared to the effort required to maintain it.\u201d\n \u2013 Kyle Peatt\nSay hello to \nSushi \n\u2013 Zomato\u2019s all-new design system that we\u2019ve built from the ground up. It\u2019s not just a design system for us, but more than that it helps us provide a new and enhanced experience for our users using the Zomato app. \nLet me break down what this \nactually\n means and what went into building Sushi.\u00a0\nWhat is a Design System?\nA design system is a large set of reusable components combined with a set of rules, storing visual design information, like colours or spacing, and enables us to build consistent applications quickly.\u00a0\nWhy build a Design System?\nOur first design system was created back in 2017. It was designed to enhance the existing features but was not as scalable as we wished it would be. That\u2019s why we started working on a more flexible and robust solution.\nGiven the pace at which Zomato is growing, it becomes imperative on our part to maintain good user experience. With every new feature we release, the aim should be to be able to utilize\n \nas many existing components so that we are not introducing any visual inconsistencies. Whether we are working with pixels, code, or words, it\u2019s helpful to have design patterns in place \u2014 they not only save time but also keep our UI consistent, thereby creating a better user experience.\nInstead of re-thinking the foundation of every new experience that we add on Zomato, the Sushi Design System will now allow designers, developers, product managers as well as other stakeholders to focus on easily transforming ideas to live products.\nHow did we come up with a brand new system?\nDesign Principle\nSome core principles we kept in mind during this process \u2013\u00a0\nUser Centricity\n \u2013 We want to ensure that every interaction our users have with our product is a positive one and solves for something, thereby building a strong connection with our brand or product across platforms \nInclusivity\n \u2013 Our products serve everyone, from teens who are still in college to people not too savvy with modern-day technology. We want to design and build our platform which is viable by as many people as possible, regardless of ability, age and geography\nSimplicity\n \u2013 We deliver delight and satisfaction through a clean and focused experience every time. By relying on existing, common design patterns that are intuitive in form, function and flow, we ensure a more user friendly interface for all\nConsistency \n\u2013 We create familiarity and strengthen intuition by applying the same solution to problems across our platforms\nStructure of Design System\nWe followed the Atomic Design methodology by \nBrad Frost\n and mapped it in our design system spectrum.\nCreating Foundations\nFoundations are digital brand guidelines, which define typography, color palettes, icons, spacing, shadow and information architecture of our design system. All foundations are atoms and are broken down into two levels \u2013 \nPrinciples \nprovide philosophical continuity but don\u2019t provide any actual code, such as \u2013 how our text will truncate, scrolling behavior, spacing, etc. so that designers will refer to it and respect it while creating new design patterns.\nBasics\n cover guidelines for aspects such as typography styles, colors, icons, imagery that help in formulating consistent components.\nComponent Library\nComponents refer to distinctive user interface (UI) elements that are used over and over throughout the development of a product \u2013 normally actionable or sometimes just to convey meanings. However, components can either be Molecules or Organisms as there is a fine line of distinction between the two. A few examples include buttons, inputs, selects, toggles, lists, ratings, tags, etc.\nEach component is defined by titles, subtitles, images, action buttons and some optional text/elements.\nAll these components are stored in a shared repository called library, which is a great way to build consistent UI and speed up the app\u2019s development. Consistency in UI increases familiarity with the app for users, bringing down user confusion to a minimum when interacting with our product.\nPattern & Templates\nAfter defining the basics, we collect all the base components, which are then used to build more complex, reusable, and scalable snippets called pattern or templates.\nThe real deal\nSo this is all we had to share with you about Sushi. The real deal is that we are finally rolling out the new Zomato App and  Zomato Web versions based on our design system, for everyone in the coming few months.\nHere\u2019s a sneak peek into our new versions \u2013\u00a0\nThe best tool for the job\nWe started building our new UI Kit, called Sushi, in the Sketch app. Because, back then everybody loved to work on a single Sketch file and only shared it when required with the help of the cloud, inVision or simply exported it. We did not highly depend on the usage of symbols or components; we just duplicated elements as needed and created another screen without using symbols to update elements. Searching for existing components and templates was always a tedious task.\nCreating style and component symbols in Sketch is very much a possible task, however maintaining/using these symbols is where life gets tough. After exploring some alternatives, we found Figma to be the best suited for our design system. Figma uses a dedicated panel for assets, that makes them easily available and better organized.\u00a0\nRead: Why we switched to Figma \nhere\n.\u00a0\nDevelopment\nAll components and patterns are being implemented in our technical frameworks across platforms and our developers are working on these to push our patterns to the finish line. Soon, we\u2019ll have everything in sync from the mobile app to web.\nWhat next?\nWe\u2019ve already been able to rely on our design system for some big projects and will continue to do so. The design system provides us with a shared understanding of our visual style and enables all of us to prototype and experiment with ideas in high fidelity faster and at a much lower cost.\nLastly, Sushi was built on the belief that we can never predict all future requirements, we can only prepare for it. It has so far been a fruitful experience, with all the engineers and product managers understanding the value of our design system. We are looking forward to see where we go with this next. \nStay tuned to our blog for more insights on our design system. \n[If you are a product designer who loves challenges and is keen on working with Zomato, do check \nthis\n out.]"

        "author": "Tania Kohli",
        "content": "Zomato hosted the 6th edition of Huddle on Product Design to focus and propagate the importance of the very core of Product Development \u2013 User Centric Design.\nWe had over 140 design enthusiasts join us from some of the best tech-enabled organizations: Rivigo, UrbanClap, Yatra, Make My Trip, OYO, Sprinklr, PayU and many more.\nFor those who couldn\u2019t make it, we have put down some of our learnings from the sessions conducted at the event. Here is what our speakers had to share:\u00a0\nSomya Hastekar (Design Lead, ThoughtWorks)\nSomya walked us through the importance of \nresponsible design\n in today\u2019s world. Over the last decade, design as a whole has stepped way beyond the realm of just being utilized to craft interfaces. With this development, there\u2019s a bigger onus.\u00a0\nIn this age of social media, where every single product is scrutinized to the very core, one should keep the following questions in mind while designing products \u2013 \nAre we hurting anyone\u2019s belief system, customs or religious views?\u00a0\nAre we ensuring our product is universal, accessible and focuses on equality?\nAre we deep-diving into actual user needs and answering the bigger \u2018whys\u2019, that are emotionally driven?\u00a0\nWe need to understand the larger influence of design on societies and cultures and be as mindful of seeing our designs from their perspectives.\nRuma Dhingra (Lead UX Researcher, Global Product \u2013 OLX Group)\nRuma took us over the methods of comprehending users, that ensure responsible product development. Before deciding on the right stage for user research application and solving for methods to be applied, a few questions one should always keep in mind are the \u2018what\u2019, \u2018who\u2019 and the \u2018how\u2019.\u00a0\nWhat\n \nis the product? What are we solving for?\nWho\n \nare its users? What all do we know about them?\nHow\n \nare the findings from the study going to be used?\nIf research sessions are conducted in a structured way, one can get close to understanding user requirements and journeys in the best possible manner.\u00a0\nHere are some things to consider during your research sessions:\u00a0\nDefine your user sample clearly to identify trends that are in line with specific parameters\nBe empathetic to your users during any kind of interactions in order to make them more comfortable in such a setup\nReact with your eyes. Be as neutral as possible during such interactions so that their responses aren\u2019t influenced by your expectations\nDocument every single detail, so you can go back and implement all changes without having to redo your research\nAnanya Mittal (Product Designer, Zomato)\nAnanya kickstarted the session by speaking about the users Zomato serves on a daily basis \u2013 Delivery Partners, Merchants, and Customers. It\u2019s very clear to us that if the first two elements aren\u2019t happy, the latter will never be able to stick to our product. Thus, it becomes even more important to ensure a user-friendly product is also built for internal products and its users.\nBy deep-diving into elements in our delivery partner app, she went on to elaborate upon aspects that may help while designing \u2013\nSet aside some time, observe and speak to users. That\u2019s when we can catch hold of the feedback we\u2019re looking for\nUse familiar interaction flows that will not involve a steep learning curve\nFind places to incorporate delightful interactions, which will not distract the users from performing their tasks\nTry and embed training in the product itself or a platform where it is easily accessible\nThe Huddle was a great success as these series of tech events keep getting better. We interacted with guests who weren\u2019t entirely related to this field but were incredibly eager to learn and understand how design can influence user behaviour. In addition to this, we also saw a great number of entrepreneurs, who were willing to learn techniques in relation to user research, that could be applied to their own product, with the sole aim of building a loyal user base.\nIt\u2019s interesting to see how, by utilizing simpler techniques and ideas in user research and design, we can formulate better and more user-friendly products.\u00a0\nFor any queries or suggestions, do reach out to us at huddle@zomato.com\n(All\n \nillustrations have been made by Shweta Bendre, Product Designer at Zomato)"

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/500-cities/",
        "author": "Mohit Gupta",
        "content": "At the \nbeginning of June\n this year, users in over 300 cities in India could order food through Zomato. Back then, we were under the assumption that we\u2019ll reach the 500 milestone by the end of August, if not September. Turns out our food delivery services are growing faster than ever before. And we are already in 500 cities .\u00a0\nAs revealed earlier on this blog, we are aggressively launching across\u00a0 Tier III and Tier IV cities for wider reach and scale. In the last month, we\u2019ve launched our ordering businesses in 120 cities. We are able to maintain this momentum thanks to our data-driven strategy of reaching out to places that show potential and come true on our set criteria.\u00a0\nSome of our latest additions are in geographies such as, Alappuzha and Malappuram (Kerala), Pushkar (Rajasthan), Ankleshwar and Mehsana (Gujarat), Kanyakumari, Kodaikanal and Cuddalore (Tamil Nadu), Itarsi and Ashoknagar (Madhya Pradesh), Fazilka and Nawanshahr (Punjab), Vrindavan and Azamgarh (Uttar Pradesh), Silvassa (Daman), Chittoor (Andhra Pradesh), Daltonganj (Jharkhand), Pataudi (Haryana), Osmanabad and Sawantwadi (Maharashtra) and Shillong (Meghalaya) \u2013 amongst others on the map. \nWe are glad to note that our food delivery services are now available in three north-eastern states.\u00a0\nThe enthusiasm from the restaurant industry and users from the lesser-known cities have been nothing less than an enormous boost to our strategy of reaching out with our vision of \u2018better food for more people\u2019. For instance, Giridih in Jharkhand, with a population of 144,000 clocked over 1000 orders on the very first day of its launch and has continued the rhythm since. In Fazilka (Punjab), with a population of 76,492, each restaurant onboard is averaging 40 orders a day. Such trends have been insightful as well as encouraging. A user in Nagaur (Rajasthan), with a population of 1.3 lakh, ordered food worth \u20b96995 \u2013 registering the highest order value from a Tier IV city. Chicken Biryani has been the most ordered non-veg item in the Tier III-IV cities while Masala Dosa took the pole position in the veg category.\u00a0\nThis has been an exhilarating ride and we are grateful to all the elements at play. \nHere are our 4 key learnings so far:\u00a0\nFar and wide is possible: \nEvery city in India, big or small, thanks to the advent of mobile penetration, is an opportunity worth exploring. We are yet to go wrong on any geographic conjecture of launch. We relish the rush of being super-quick operationally but are also humbled by our collective efforts of making things happen in the not-so-inhabited regions. All our metrics (orders per thousand, value per order) have proven the commonly held belief that India\u2019s economy is driven by Tier 1 and II cities only, wrong. The top 15 cities contributed 100% of our Delivery business 12 months ago. While the growth in those cities has tripled in the last 12 months, other cities now contribute 40 per cent of our business.\nTwo wheels, one ecosystem: \nStaying true to the belief system behind our \nDelivery Universe\n, we are mobilizing people towards better employment. With every single launch, we are observing a spike in the number of delivery partners who are willing to work with us \u2013 not just those who own motorcycles but also those with bicycles at their disposal.\nThe beauty of brand recall\n: One of the most interesting and repetitive events has been the way people (both users and restaurants partners) have shown a desire to have our food delivery services made available in their respective cities and towns. We didn\u2019t have to sell our brand hard\u00a0 as people are already aware of how synonymous we are with food.\u00a0\nChallenges don\u2019t last long\n: With a dedicated team and a singular focus, we have set out realistic goals across varied geographies. It goes without saying that we\u2019ve faced operational challenges \u2014 for instance, despite their overwhelming drive to join us, we had to educate some of our restaurant partners about our concerns for food safety \u2014 but none of them has made us regret our initial call to go ahead. And we firmly believe that this won\u2019t change in our next milestone either \nWe hope to keep going until there are no new places left to explore. \nLastly, our ongoing journey has made us acutely aware of the India\u2019s rich diversity and I am particularly proud of my team for making it possible to bridge the gap between our users and their favourite food items."

It goes without saying that a majority of our partners abide by these principles and put up their best performances, but we\u2019ve zoomed in on a few internal metrics to select a set of restaurants that have been \nexceptionally\n great in upholding \nvery high\n standards of user experience. It\u2019s safe to suggest that these restaurants have produced the widest smiles amongst our users.\nGoing by our customer delight measures, we\u2019ve selected 4 restaurants \u2013 one each from Bangalore, Jaipur, NCR and Nellore \u2013 they are \nBrahmin\u2019s Thatte Idli\n, \nAgarwal Caterers\n, \nSalad Days\n and \nHotel Reshma\n respectively.

Last month, we went ahead with a \nnew 26-week parental leave policy\n \u2013 a move that has been largely appreciated by our employees, the media and our peers. Through the feedback, we realised that whether folks were parents or not, they were touched by our empathy. It was humbling reading all the emails and texts.\u00a0\nWe have always believed that a meaningful alignment of people\u2019s personal and professional goals allows us to bring our best to work.\nHowever, we can\u2019t be done yet; there\u2019s a lot of work to do. After all, parental policy can\u2019t merely stop at leave policy, it must extend to parental care \u2013 and much more as well.\nWith this belief in our hearts, we recently inaugurated our first in-house creche \u2014 in partnership with \nIpsaa\n \u2014 at our headquarters in Gurgaon. Parents in our organization with children between the age group of 6 months up to 7 years are now availing this option from Monday to Friday between 8:30 am to 8:00 pm. And the entire facility carries zero cost for zomans.\u00a0\nSome of the activities provided here for the children include book reading, storytelling, clay modelling, music, sensory development, language and communication, motor skills and coordination, mobility and exercise. The creche has been designed keeping in mind a child\u2019s need for space and nurture.\u00a0\nIn our organization, there are several parents, who have been depending on family members or creches outside for child care. We have tried to lessen their domestic worries as they would be relieved to know that their children are barely a few steps away from them \u2014 at any given point of time. Most importantly, with this initiative, we hope to provide a stress-free daycare option for Zoman parents.\u00a0\nBy all accounts, it has been an encouraging start but the idea doesn\u2019t end here for us. We are already working on expanding this facility and introducing creches to other offices in various cities \u2014 where we have large teams."

        "content": "I have been a part of the Zomato family for a little more than four years now, and it\u2019s definitely been one hell of a journey. I began my career in the Content team, and I am now a part of the Product team. Yes, that happens here. Interest and ability are given shape, into super opportunities that can change your life.\nCurrently, I am involved in a project with \nFeeding India\n; an organization which focuses on solving for hunger and food waste with Zomato. In order to scale this across different locations\n \n(volunteers and partners), we are working towards bringing people who wish to donate, who want to volunteer, and the hungry \u2013 seamlessly onto a single platform.\nI have been a part of this team for about seven months now, and have worked on one more project before this. Even though I have not had any prior experience in Product, I got an opportunity to work in this space by frequently taking part in the internal bug bounty programs \u2013 where zomans are encouraged to discover and report bugs in the latest Zomato app.\nSuch programs changed my perspective in relation to how I would view and use our apps and gradually helped me comprehend the entire ecosystem of product design and development. My enthusiasm for sending bugs didn\u2019t die. I am sure I would have annoyed a few people with my enthusiasm. Few people even suggested that I should be in the QA team, but it turned out to be a stepping stone to Product.\nMost people in Product don\u2019t start their careers as Product Managers \u2013 it\u2019s a goal they work towards. And here I am working towards mine \u2013 one day at a time.\nGetting started at Product Management\nGetting a chance to work in the Product team seemed unreal at that time. Most people would give an arm and a leg for a chance like this. I was nervous that it would require me to interact with some of the smartest people in the organization, who have had a lot of experience in Product unlike me, but this was an opportunity to learn and I could not let this slide. In hindsight, I have had many learnings, big and small, about Product Management; each learning also acted as a feedback loop for me to develop personal skills, which will always add value to whatever I do.\nMy learnings so far \u2013\nUnderstand what is the problem you\u2019re trying to solve for, before jumping to solutions \nWhile the end goal is to design a product, we get so lost in ideas that we seem to lose track of the problem we are trying to solve. When I started working on the mocks for an app, I had so many ideas in my head and started making flowcharts and mocks one after another. When I sat down to explain my work to a designer, I realised that in the excitement of implementing the solution, I lost track of why I was doing it in the first place; and also ended up spending a lot more time than required. We are very quick with coming up with solutions \u2013 solutions make us feel good. But defining the problem statement you\u2019re trying to solve makes your intent very clear. I use this approach in my personal life as well and it always helps to get more clarity.\nSuggesting multiple ways of implementing a product is a bad idea\nIt\u2019s all about having one solution, which according to \nyou\n will be the best way to execute the product, and having complete clarity of why it\u2019s the best method. I remember sharing a document with Deepi, writing down my ideas about implementing \nZomaland\n in the Zomato app \u2013 I failed to put my point forward while trying to think of multiple solutions. Lesson: it was a moment of realisation that improving my writing skills will help communicate my ideas better.\nStart with paper, and practice\nDigital tools like Invision or Sketch seem more interesting to start prototyping your ideas and unleash your creative side. It took me a whole day just to ideate and make wireframes for four screens on Invision, which didn\u2019t even make it to the final design. This was clearly a waste of time and I would never be able to make designs for the whole app by this speed. From that moment onward, I started to carry A4 size sheets in my bag and used them when I needed to put down my ideas/thoughts at any time. Paper prototyping is quick and intuitive. It takes lesser amount of time and effort as compared to digital tools. It\u2019s easier to get rid of them and move on without getting too attached to it. \nNo work is above or beneath you\nProduct management is a broad role, this often means that you are required to step up and do whatever work is required to help your team ship the product, even if it\u2019s not a part of your job description. There were times when the team I was a part of needed someone to extract data for business analysis, and someone who could send out the marketing communications. There was no point of getting another person just for this, plus we had no time to wait. I figured I could additionally take care of any requirements for data or marketing for the time being. I realised that a little extra effort from my end helped my team in a huge way through this project.\nLearning never stops for anyone in the Zomato Product Team. One of the most insightful sessions for me was the Product Bootcamp at the farmhouse with Deepi, where in 24 hours we exponentially grew our skills. People were having candid discussions about real-time product experiences, in addition to the several articles we were given to read at our own pace. After the Product Bootcamp, we were also trained by the design team to design our own mocks on Figma. Everyone got to design their own restaurant page using the common toolkit. Who would have thought that you could get to pause your routine work and learn new things at work together?! It gives me great joy when I look at the designs I have made for my current project, from scratch. \nDisclaimer: I did take help from the design team to polish my design as it\u2019s impossible to get to that level of perfection so soon.\nWhat makes me want to get my best self to work\nIt\u2019s a great feeling to work in a company where everyone is always striving to learn more every day and people who are willing to learn are supported in all ways in the organisation. That\u2019s how someone like me, with a background in Civil engineering and having zero experience in Product, is part of this great Product team. I love the fact that I get to enhance my knowledge and skills at work, at my own will and based on my own interest, which makes me want to come to work each and every day. At Zomato, we believe that you don\u2019t inspire people by the designation you hold, what inspires people is your attitude towards problem-solving and diligence even when no one is watching."

        "content": "Our mission at Zomato is better food for more people. We consider the underserved and the underprivileged as part of our purview of more people.\nThink about this \u2013 according to \nFAO estimates\n, over 190 million people in India are undernourished (which is approximately 20% of our population). And one-third of world\u2019s \nstunted\n children are from India. In spite of this, it is estimated by the UN that nearly \n40% of food in India is wasted or lost\n.\u00a0\nFood wastage in India happens at multiple levels \u2013 harvesting, transporting, processing, packaging and consuming. Weddings, events, restaurants, hostels and houses are a major source for food wastage of cooked food.\u00a0\nSomeone has to do something significant to address this core issue of our country. And we think we can contribute to easing the pain. In the past, we\u2019ve worked closely with \nFeeding India\n, \nRobin Hood Army\n and \nAkshaya Patra Foundation\n to alleviate some of these problems and have collectively achieved remarkable results. It\u2019s something we are extremely proud of. \nWe have now begun a new, and a more concrete chapter around serving the underserved by acquiring\n \nFeeding India\n. It is an important step for us, as both organizations share a common dream of ending hunger and food wastage \u2014 not just in India, but globally.\u00a0\nThe Feeding India team is now completely integrated into Zomato. We have been working together (out of the same office \u2013\u00a0our HQ) for about 6 months now \u2013 and the results have been tremendous.\u00a0\nWithin these 6 months of working together, we\u2019ve been able to unlock the massive potential that comes with our reach and scale. In December of 2018, Feeding India distributed 78,300 monthly meals to the underprivileged. That figure has now skyrocketed to over 1.1 million meals a month\n.\n\u00a0\nSimilarly, the number of cities Feeding India is active in has risen from 65 to 82. The number of Hunger Heroes (volunteers at Feeding India) has grown from 8,500 to 21,500.\nZomato and Feeding India also closely collaborated during the \nOdisha cyclone crisis\n. It showed us how we can leverage public support to convert it to social good. In over 24 hours we were able to set up #techforgood, activate our users, partners and volunteers to get 75,000 meals along with necessities for daily survival for a month to 16,500+ people in Odisha.\u00a0\nThis positive impact was made possible thanks to two main reasons: the unbridled enthusiasm shown by the Feeding India team led by Ankit and the reach and trust Zomato has with its users.\nFeeding India is a not-for-profit organization. \nAnd we have acquired it. What does that mean?\nThat means that Feeding India will continue to be a non profit. Zomato will fund the entire salaries of the team \u2013 and some core initiatives. For example, Zomato will fund the development of the \u2018Feedi.ng\u2019 app \u2013 this app will connect donors and volunteers at a scale never seen before, and we are hoping that in a few years, it will be the platform to serve at least 100m underprivileged people every month. All the money with Feeding India will remain with Feeding India and be used for their mission \u201cfood for everyone\u201d \u2013 which we think is a necessary part of our bigger mission \u201cbetter food for more people.\u201d\nWe are revamping the Feeding India website, and in the spirit of transparency, we will be publishing quarterly financials on the website. We are aiming to get the first Feeding Global \u2013\u00a0Financial Transparency Report, out by October 2019.\nFood for everyone is not something we can solve alone. We need every food organisation to come together and tackle this important issue with our combined resources and knowhow. We are thankful to Accenture, Elanpro, Tupperware, Uber Eats, OYO, Sodexo, and everyone else for being generous partners in this ongoing mission. \nAnkit and I also want to \nthank all our Hunger Heroes \nfor helping us achieve such encouraging results within a relatively short period of time. And we are certain about keeping the momentum high \u2013 and in fact, even making it better."

        "content": "I still remember the day when I first came to Zomato, it was for one of their Tech Recruitment Programmes, \nTrial Week\n. I hadn\u2019t really heard much about Zomato before this and honestly wasn\u2019t sure if this was the space I wanted to be in. Adding on to this, there was a perception of Zomato as an organisation that frequently resorted to the concept of \u2018hire fast, fire fast\u2019, which made me increasingly hesitant to add Zomato to my list of top companies.\nYou must be wondering why I then sent in my application in the first place. Well, the application for a week-long programme was to try and step out of my comfort zone. Before this, I was working in Chandigarh, which is my hometown, and had no plans of permanently shifting to another city. I was happy with my work, and always felt comfortable knowing that home was nearby. But a thought of trying something new had been lingering in my mind for long and what was better than to spend a week, having the choice to evaluate an organisation first hand? Zomato gave me a chance to live the life of a Zoman for a week and if everything went well, I could stay on. If this didn\u2019t happen, I could take that experience back and carry on with what I was happy doing. \nAt the end of the week, I was successful and was offered a chance to become a full-time employee here. I definitely had mixed feelings about this at that point, as this wasn\u2019t something I had planned or decided to take on. But I stuck on and today, I am glad I did. It\u2019s been 4 years for me and my learnings from Zomato aren\u2019t even close to fading out. \nThe first leg of my journey\nDuring my initial days of working here, I had the opportunity of working with Gunjan Patidar, our CTO. I was working on small features and bug fixes for Web at that point, and even though these were not the most critical tasks he had at hand, he still made sure he took me over every little detail. I was amazed at the clarity he had on every aspect and the way he demonstrated the entire flow of our product. I still have that sheet of paper on which he illustrated an overview of one of the systems I was supposed to work on. Of course, he was an expert at what he does, but also embodied what Zomans truly stand for \u2013 he was down to earth, humble and approachable. It wasn\u2019t like I had ever perceived a CTO to be like. \nFew months down the line, I was moved into the Food Delivery team, where I was involved in integrating different merchants into our system. Even though I faced a great number of challenges here, but the learnings were even more in number and depth \u2013 integrating APIs in our current flow, planning step by step feature releases for each merchant, improving UX, decreasing error rates and increasing order volumes at the same time. This experience helped me gain a holistic understanding of one of the most critical business verticals for Zomato. In fact, these integrations helped in getting some of the biggest chains live on Zomato, which contribute largely to our daily order volumes today. \nI then shifted into the consumer backend team, where most of my time was utilised by keeping a constant check on the response time of every crucial API and conducting regular optimisations. It was amazing to experience how a small change in the app or a slight improvement in API response time can increase your Order Through Rate. At Zomato, we believe in constant evolution and are defining tasks for optimisation at every stage of development. Every single individual is given the time and freedom to seek their own unique ways to contribute to our vision. At Zomato, we don\u2019t believe in hiring merely to fill up numbers, we believe in hiring to bring in people that are open to learning novel techniques and keep the value of ownership at the highest pedestal. \nIt\u2019s amazing to see how much people have moved around and the wide range of projects they\u2019ve worked upon here \u2013 it gives you the chance to express your interest and shift projects as and when you feel you can contribute immensely to them, and if there\u2019s a requirement within the team. Counterintuitively, the less I ask for, the more I receive at Zomato.\nWhat\u2019s in store for me in the coming years?\nI am now contributing to making a shift from monolithic to service-oriented architecture, where we are breaking the current system into services, based on the specific functionalities. Additionally, we are rebuilding everything from scratch by supporting old features and making them easily extensible for new features. This shift is helping us reduce incremental feature development time and is even better in testing and scaling each component individually.   \nOver the last few years, I have not only learnt a great deal in relation to what I do but also around what I can do and achieve. We all have to push ourselves to realise what we\u2019re capable of. Each day has been challenging \u2013 from designing, testing, shipping features and services, managing time for reviews, bug fixes and simultaneously writing code. I have worked on such different projects now, that I feel I have the ability to learn anything I wish to take up here. \nZomato, is like a second home to me now. There is different kind of energy and amiability, which motivates me to come here every day and contribute to the larger vision of \u2018better food for more people\u2019."

        "content": "People join a company for the brand, and stay for the culture. Our Trial Week gives potential Zomans the chance to experience both the brand, and the culture \u2013 up close.\nOver 3500 applications, 50 participants and 19 offers rolled out. This season of Trial Week has already begun on a fantastic note for us. \nIt\u2019s been 7 weeks since we kickstarted our first Trial Week \u2013 Season 2019. Engineers from all over the country registered to work with Zomato for a week and go through an extended two sided evaluation of mutual fit.\nWhen it comes to engineers, how well can both parties really evaluate each other through a 2 or 3 round interview process? It surely helps us comprehend skill set, basic culture fit, and a surface level understanding of who they really are. But is it the best way to actually recruit, or for them to choose a place to work at? Maybe not. \nIt\u2019s a long, monotonous \n(sometimes)\n and exhausting process for both sides involved. \nWe believe the entire point of a hiring process is to ensure we are confident enough to decide to take the plunge of spending a lot of time working with someone \u2013 on an everyday basis. And this is what Trial Week does for us. It gives us an opportunity to spend enough time with talent, work on real world problems with them \u2013 make some friends, and eventually if both parties decide so, choose to work with each other as part of the same time. \nLooking at the Trial Week from an engineer\u2019s lens, they get \u2013 \nA chance to work on real problems that affect millions of users daily\nA taste of our culture and an understanding of what a typical day at Zomato looks like\nTrial Week is now an ongoing program\nAfter witnessing the quality of experience and outcome during Trial Week, we have decided to adopt this as an on-going program at Zomato. This also gives us an opportunity to open up additional slots and provide a chance to more people to participate in the program. \nFor a candidate, it\u2019s always hard to picture their life at an organisation when they\u2019ve only attended a couple of formal interviews at their workplace. We want candidates to live the life of an engineer at Zomato for a week, in its truest form possible. \nTo ensure this, we provide every candidate with:\nA mentor \u2013 to guide them through their week at Zomato\nA challenge \u2013 that is specifically designed, based on their skill set \nTravel and stay arrangements \u2013 in case they\u2019re coming in from another city\nMeals \u2013 all three of them, which will be provided at the Zomato cafeteria \nAssets \u2013 to help them execute all their tasks in the most efficient manner\nWhether a candidate makes it as a full-time Zoman or not, our basic aim through the process is to ensure that they have fun and are given tasks that are challenging enough to instil some amount of learning, that can guide them wherever they plan to go after. \nWhat did our participants have to say?\nMayur Bhangale, joined us as a Software Development Engineer earlier this month and described Trial Week as a recruitment process, where one is purely evaluated as who they are and not as how they pretend to be. \n \n\u201cThis process has no typical CLRS tests, no whiteboards, and includes no sit-down interviews. The challenge at hand is a real-world problem and you are evaluated on the approach, execution, and quality of work.\nI was surrounded by extremely hard working Zomans, which set a huge bar for me and managed to complete my challenge in 3 days, after which I was immediately offered a job.\u201d\nAnother participant, Prakhar Shrivastava took us over his week at the Zomato headquarters.\n\u201cI realized that one week is enough to see a visible change in one\u2019s knowledge and concepts. Working with my mentor was an absolute pleasure \u2013 his thinking and ideas to optimize the application, in order for it to scale well was something that helped me a lot.\nBrainstorming ideas and discussing different approaches to completing the challenge were the most insightful parts of the week.\u201d\nWe have a plethora of engineering problem statements that are ready to be solved for at Zomato and thus are on the lookout for passionate engineers who can contribute to this in their own unique ways. \nIf you have an immense passion for code and trust your ability to solve problems under high-pressure situations, we would love for you to be a \npart of this program\n and \u2018demo\u2019 working \nfor\n \nwith us at Zomato. \nFor any queries, do drop us an email at \ntrialweek@zomato.com."

This is unprecedented, he says.\nEnters Deepi. Crowd goes wild. At least my brain cells do. I gear up for an impassioned speech by one of India\u2019s most prolific founders.\nMuch misinformed, I am. This session isn\u2019t about him. It\u2019s about us, the seven mint-fresh business school graduates, our passions, motivations and\u2026 our hidden talents (more on that later).\nDeepi, now joined by Steve, asks us what we wish to do at Zomato. I go first. \u201cumm\u2026I want to do sales or marketing\u2026\u201d, I muster in absolute vagueness. Thinking through answers hasn\u2019t been my strong suite. But I am extremely passionate about branding. To that end, I went back to school to make a \u2018switch\u2019 from finance.\nAnyway, one thing leads to another, and 5 minutes later, I am now projecting my fledgling web-comics Instagram handle on a gigantic LED screen. Standing beside the now almost life-size, poorly drawn stick-figures, I awkwardly explain my \u2018art\u2019 and my juvenile sense of humour. It\u2019s not as awkward as I\u2019d like to believe.\nThe next thing I know, I am sitting with Gaurav (GV), the cola veteran, trying to come up with Zomato\u2019s next viral campaign. Is this a dream? I can\u2019t tell (yet). My B-school buddies too have been mapped to their interests, starting their careers (2.0, because ISB) in the functions of choice. Deepi himself hand-picked projects for each one of us.\nI\u2019ve been here a month now. While it\u2019s (really) too early to make large, sweeping conclusions about Zomato, I\u2019ve witnessed some rather remarkable things that have helped shape a very positive first impression. It\u2019s not the norm for a company\u2019s founder to chit-chat this freely with new recruits, let alone have them pick projects or host them at home!\nI\u2019ve worked in start-ups before, but Zomato\u2019s \u201cvibe\u201d is unique. And the vibe attracts its tribe. Between the oh-so-dramatic agency pitches and internal ideation sessions, I\u2019ve seen some of the most creative minds at work. Not just marketers, but also the product folks, the payments team, (surprise, surprise!) the HR\u2026 \u2013 there\u2019s a bunch of motivated ideators wherever I look.\nAs a recent MBA, I had almost begun finding comfort in Excels and PowerPoints, until I joined Zomato. Here, it\u2019s about big ideas and execution. About capturing aha-moments on pen and paper. On keeping it real and walking the talk. In that, Zomato is as startup-y as it gets. There\u2019s extreme ownership of work (not surprising that multiple copies of \na book by the same name\n are housed in the office library). Oh yes, there\u2019s a library \u2013 a mini-Zen room \u2013 in the middle of the office. With a curated list of some of the most inspiring books of recent times.\nWe are encouraged to read, to talk to folks and gain perspective. This is certainly unlike the ruthless \u201creal world\u201d our professors at B-school warned us about. A utopian finishing school to my terminal degree \u2013 I\u2019d say. Only a month in, but I feel a sense of belonging to this place.\nWell begun, but only 1% done."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/parental-leave-policy/",
        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "At Zomato, we believe that people produce their best work when their personal and professional goals meaningfully intersect and align. We have also always taken pride in building a culture of meritocracy \u2013 something which starts failing when it comes to equality between men and women at the workplace. This happens for various reasons \u2013 societal norms, precedents, and sometimes, even government policies.\nOne core issue that leads to fewer women leaders in organisations, the community, and the nation is the lack of universal paid parental leave. Currently, it is hard for women to lead a healthy family life \nand\n focus on their careers, leading to a lot of women leaving their jobs or putting their careers on the back burner. This results in a pressing lack of diversity across all levels of the organization, and needs to be solved proactively.\nWhile we have been lucky to attract and nurture some of the strongest female leaders I have ever met, it has been incredibly hard to find women leaders out there at senior levels. Majority of the senior positions in the world are currently filled by men \u2013 and even if an organisation wants to focus on gender balance in the senior ranks within, it is almost impossible to do that because of the supply bias.\nAccording to me, a lot of that imbalance at the top stems from an unequal leave policy for men and women when they welcome their children to this world. \nI believe that young parents should be able to make a choice of how to care for their children. And that a myopic view of primary care-giving not only alienates one half of our workforce, but also creates circumstances that lead to fewer female leaders within organisations, the community and the nation.\nGandhi said \u2013\u00a0\u2019be the change you wish to see in the world\u2019. Which is why we have made some changes to our parental leave policies today.\nFor women across the globe (we have teams in 13 countries as we speak), we will be offering 26 weeks paid leave, or will follow the government mandated policy, whichever is more. We will be offering \nexactly\n the same benefits to men as well. There won\u2019t be even an iota of difference in parental leave policy for men and women at Zomato going forward.\nThis policy also applies to non birthing parents, and in cases of surrogacy, adoption, and same-sex partners.\nWe understand the first few weeks once a new member arrives can be financially straining for the young family. In addition to the flexibility and empowerment to care for their families as they deem fit, the new parents will also be given an endowment of $1000, per child, as they welcome their new baby to the world. \nThese policy changes are applicable to even those Zomans who have had a child within the last 6 months. \nWe also wish that governments across the world institutionalised paid parental leave (\nthe way Nordics do\n) \u2013 that will be the right thing to do for organisations as well as individuals. In fact, it\u2019s time all major organizations took a step towards this much needed way of life.\nThere\u2019s an African adage \u2013 it takes a village to raise a child. And while a village is ideal, a world where both parents are allowed, rather encouraged to assume equal responsibility is a fair start. We will never have truly gender-neutral organisations unless we have gender-neutral communities and gender-neutral nations."

Particularly when we are running a marathon. A few weeks ago, we crossed the 200-city barrier for our food delivery business in India.\nAnd today, we have crossed the 300 city milestone \u2013 meaning 300+ cities in India can now order online on Zomato \u2013 and are currently operating in varied places like Bhuj and Junagadh in Gujarat, Rishikesh and Mussoorie in Uttarakhand, Shimla in Himachal Pradesh, Hosur and Nagercoil in Tamil Nadu, Ayodhya and Raebareli in Uttar Pradesh, Chikmagalur and Bhatkal in Karnataka, Kharagpur in West Bengal, Chhapra and Begusarai in Bihar, Hazaribagh and Ramgarh in Jharkhand, Jalna and Parbhani in Maharashtra, and so on. \nIt is important to pause and understand the import of this milestone. There are 40 cities in India with a population of over a million and over 380 cities in India with a population of over 100,000. When you fundamentally move beyond the 40 cities to the 380, you are truly representing India. And this is central to our mission of \nbetter food for more people\n, to scale our service to every corner of India.\nPrior to this phase, our food delivery services were present in only two cities (Guwahati and Nagaon) in one northeastern state \u2013 Assam. And now, we have launched three more cities (Silchar and Dibrugarh in Assam and Agartala in Tripura) \u2013 bringing the total to five cities in two NE states. This is a small yet committed step to our future presence in the Seven Sister States. \u00a0\nWhile expanding, we take three main factors into consideration \u2013\nPopulation\n \u2013 the chosen city/town has to have over a lakh inhabitants so that our intended operation can be carried out efficiently as well as effectively\nStudents as a demographic\n \u2013 even if the chosen city is tiny in area, having a considerable percentage of student presence encourages us to pilot our services there; 10 years from now, we think that these students are going to be our biggest and most influential brand ambassadors, and we want to grow up with them and be an important part of their journey\nSupply \n\u2013 are there enough restaurants who can bear the operational brunt of an instant uptick in demand from spikes in food delivery occasions \u2013 weekends, late-night, extreme weather\nIn the recently concluded phase of city launches, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh have ticked all the three boxes above and proved to be the most active, with the highest number of launches.\nYes, these are exciting times as we continue to build deeper in existing cities and test unchartered territories across the country. We are onboarding 45-50 restaurants in each city on average; a figure that\u2019s bound to move northward over the coming weeks. \nThe most endearing and humbling aspect of this expansion has been the inclusion of delivery partners from the smaller cities/towns who wish to make food deliveries on their bicycles. Instead of insisting on motorcycles, we are encouraging them to go ahead with their bicycles as \nwe continue to work on introducing e-cycles\n in the upcoming fleet. And that has happened along with us continuing to improve our average delivery times, which now stand at 30.5 minutes.\nEach new city is a new mini-chapter for me. And I\u2019m intensely proud that our teams have stood up to any and every challenge, whether operational or logistical, that diverse India has thrown at them. \nWe are sprinting forward to let the real India have a taste of Zomato and for Zomato to deliver to more of India. And so far, Indians are loving what we have to serve."

        "content": "At Zomato, we never judge your eating habits. Whether it\u2019s Biryani or Salads, we have everything you love! But unfortunately, people have been \nfat-shaming \nour android app for a while. Not cool \u2013 so we decided to do something about it.\nSpace on your phones, and the data you consume are both important for us, and we have taken steps so that our app sheds some weight and also sticks to better eating habits.\u00a0\nA few months back, our app was\u00a0\n23MB\n to download from the Play Store and for many of our long-time users, had cache sizes going up to \n600\u2013700MB. \nAll that is a thing of the past. This is where we are at right now \u2013 \nApp download size from Play Store =\u00a0\n15~16MB\nApp cache size = limited to\u00a0\n120MB\nOrdering home screen scroll consumes\n\u00a060-70%\u00a0\nless bandwidth\nAnd no, we did not stop adding new features to our app during this time. We continued to add new features, while we were reducing the size of the app. Some notable additions in the last couple of months were\u200a\u2014\u200a\nA brand new flow for adding your location\nZomato Premier League\u200a\u2014\u200awhich we are sure you had a great time participating in \n(Play Zomato Cricket Cup if you\u2019re missing ZPL!)\nHow did we manage this?\nApk Size Reduction\nApp Bundles\nAs you might have read\u00a0\nin our last update\n, our build time optimization efforts also made it possible to make app bundles. This directly resulted in up to 22% reduction in app download size. \nResource Optimisation\nWe also converted all PNG files to WebP wherever it was much smaller. We noticed, especially for blurred photos \n(like the ones used in backgrounds, splashscreens)\n, WebP assets are almost 10x smaller than PNG.\u00a0\nAlso, we donned our janitor hats and cleaned up all unused resources \n(images, layouts, strings) .\nThe majority of the reduction happened via the above two steps, but in this period we also removed a net\u00a0\n300,000 lines of code\n, and removed 4 libraries we use in the app. \nRemoving Unused\u00a0Code\nSometimes when you look back at your codebase, especially if it is 8 years old, you find not just functions or files, but entire modules that are completely unused, and sometimes even dangerously\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cseems unused\u201d. \ud83d\ude05\nThe mobile platform team at Zomato thought of taking up this task of removing as much code from the app as possible, without reducing any functionality or feature. \nThus, in the last 2 months, the contributions of the mobile platform team has been a net negative number of lines of code to the app codebase.\nCache Limits\nWe did extensive testing and figured that 100mb of cache is sufficient for us to quickly load the order home page \n(restaurants around you)\n thumbnails. For a food ordering app, it is unjust to ask for more than 100MB of space from your device. Also, the way we loaded fonts and other assets often led to the creation of zombie temp files, that were unused but piled up in the cache. We fixed all of that, and now you will never see the Zomato app having more than 120MB of cache. \nOrder Homepage Bandwidth Conservation\nWhen you scroll through the list of restaurants for ordering, the thumbnails that are shown on the left were downloaded of 675\u00d7675 pixels.\u00a0\nWe now calculate the exact size that is needed \n(this differs from phone to phone and also depends on screen density)\n, and fetch only that size.\u00a0\nSo you can scroll through our endless list of restaurants, without worrying about your data pack now."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/why-we-switched-to-figma-as-a-primary-design-tool-at-zomato/",
        "author": "Vijay Verma",
        "content": "I got the opportunity to be a part of Zomato\u2019s kickass design team in 2018. What absolutely struck me was an extremely talented design army of independently different mindsets, all under one roof. There was a lot for me to learn and lots to share.\nBack then we had the following tools in our design stack\u200a\u2014\u200a\nSketch App\n: for interface design and UI kit\nAbstract\u00a0or\u00a0Github:\n\u00a0for version control\nInvision\n\u00a0\nor\u00a0Marvel:\n\u00a0for creating prototypes of mobile and web projects\nAdobe CC\n: for illustrations, design assets, and animation\nPrinciple App:\n\u00a0for animated design and interactive user interfaces for demos\nZeplin\n: for developer hand-off\nUsing all these tools and maintaining the design ecosystem sanity was not an easy task. Even though we had a repository of design files saved on the cloud, but other team members had a hard time finding files they were looking for and this lead to a lot of to and fro between the design team and other people. After a few months of struggle, we realized that maintaining design guidelines and UI kits was a constant effort and so we required a better solution for this.\nI remember for the longest period, \u2018Sketch\u2019 had been the most popular and beloved design tool and there was a time when everyone was migrating from Photoshop to Sketch. When this new tool called \u2018Figma\u2019 arrived, it was considered a free alternative. Since its inception, it has massively evolved and now has plenty of useful features. I started using Figma for a very small project and soon realized that it could also be used to replace our current design stack. \nThe design team at Zomato \n(including myself)\n has been using Figma for a few months now and here\u2019s why I recommend it to my fellow design community \u2013\nFigma is not just a free version of Sketch\nFigma is a cloud-based design tool that is similar to Sketch in functionality and features, but with big differences that make Figma better for team collaboration. A plus feature on Figma is that people using Sketch currently can easily import their Sketch files on Figma, hassle-free.\n1. Platform independent\nWe know designers love Mac whereas developers love Linux. Few other teams in an organization also have Windows OS. What\u2019s brilliant is that Figma can bring everyone together when it comes to getting feedback or sharing specifications. And that\u2019s because Figma works on any operating system that runs a web browser \u2013 Mac, Windows, Linux machines or even the iPad. \n2. Team Collaboration and\u00a0Feedback\nFigma has the same collaboration feature as any Google doc. Since it runs on the cloud, anyone can be given access to a design file via its URL. Because of this, teams can share files, gather feedback, and iterate faster to come up with the best version.\nOther teams outside the design territory can also work on the same file and share feedback. For example, one could invite the content team to proof-read all the copies instead of having it done on a separate document or sheet.\nThe platform also gives unlimited view-only accounts \n(which are absolutely free!)\n, where viewers can leave comments as their feedback.\n3. Team\u00a0library\u00a0\nFigma has a\u00a0\nTeam Library\n\u00a0feature similar to Sketch\u2019s shared symbol library but is more flexible and easier to design with. Team library helps to create a\u00a0\nrobust\n\u00a0\ndesign system\n. This is usually a file, or a series of files, that contains all of a team\u2019s master components and styles. Anyone from the design team can enable or disable assets on the fly if need be.\n4. Prototyping\nMany prototyping tools that allow us to import our mockups are extremely fruitful, and these come with some really cool features. But if one requires a quick prototype without having to waste time by switching to another tool, then Figma is a good option. Its prototyping feature allows us to create interactive flows that simulate how a user may interact with our designs. Hence, it eliminates the need for a separate prototyping tool.\n5. Handoff\nFigma also contains a design specification feature that helped us move away from Zeplin. It displays code snippets on any selected frame or object in CSS, iOS, or Android formats for developers to use when reviewing a design file. The design components in any file can then be \ninspected by developers.\nNote: Figma does enable full integration with\u00a0\nZeplin\u00a0\nas well.\nWhat do we conclude?\nBefore Figma,\n\u00a0several other tools \n(mentioned above)\n were used to facilitate the exchange of design mockups and updates. The iteration cycle was a series of back and forth file updates, for teams to review and implement the design.\nAfter Figma,\n the need of using other tools and services gets killed as everything comes in one single package. Third-party tools are no longer necessary (\nbut could be used if required\n).\nAll in all, we could say that this switch has simplified the design process and is more effective than other programs at helping designers and teams work together efficiently.\nNote: Figma is not paying us for this, nor did we get a discount in exchange for this post. We think Figma is a great tool, and your organization will benefit from what it brings to the table."

        "author": "Vivek Choudhary",
        "content": "Once upon a time, there was a guy who heard about Zomato being one of the coolest companies in town, with an office situated in a farmhouse \u2013 that had a pool and a big garden! In August 2013, he showed up for an interview. First of all, the place did not look like an office. His interview went well and he joined Zomato\u2019s Marketing Team. \nNo points for guessing \u2013 \nI\n was \nthat\n guy.\nAlmost everybody in the office claimed to be a foodie. I knew one thing about myself \u2013 I wasn\u2019t a foodie. I still remember what one of my future peers told me in an interview \u2013 \u201cwhether you know it or not, everyone\u2019s a foodie.\u201d\nThe Marketing Team made all the \u2018cool\u2019 stuff you saw everywhere. The people in my team were beyond amazing. I couldn\u2019t have asked for more.\nBack then, every graphic designer I knew, had only one dream \u2014 to work at Zomato and make those quirky social media posts. I was passionate about animation, and used to think of everything in motion. But here, all ideas started with the word \nminimal\n. People were crazy about \u201cminimal design\u201d.\nI still remember the first marketing creative I made for Zomato. The whole team received individual briefs from Akshar Pathak to make anything which can be cool. I don\u2019t know how many articles I must have read that day. I was scribbling and taking notes when suddenly I landed on a quote by Steve Jobs: \u201cStay hungry, stay foolish.\u201d I thought to myself, \u201cBut why when there\u2019s Zomato?\u201d I immediately jumped into execution mode. Next day, when I presented my work to Akshar. For the record, it is impossible to impress him. But no thanks to any graphic or illustration, it did great. \nThose who understand animation would know how much effort actually goes into making them. If I have to explain in simple words, a 5-min Tom & Jerry episode would roughly have 7,000 individual images. And then the render time, and all the jing bang that you have to do to come up with something presentable. (or maybe, I am not that skilled in animation, after all).\nBut with minimalism as one of the core philosophies of our marketing team, I was hooked. I couldn\u2019t stop creating stuff. Akshar asked me whether I was on something. Akshar and Shantanu (a.k.a. Shanty \u2013 the coolest guy I ever met in Zomato) were my go-to people. I am sure, they kept a plastic bag to throw up every time I would take an idea to them. \nAkshar would either say, \u201c\nkya bakwas hai ye\u201d\n or \u201c\nye bohat mast hai abhi daalte hai ise\u201d.\nMy worst nightmare happened two years later when Akshar decided to join AIB. And I thought Akshar doesn\u2019t slog like the rest of us, honestly. I was under the impression that he only makes cool creatives and writes jokes on Twitter. Most people still think so. But I was wrong. As soon as he was out of Zomato, Zomans started reaching out to me from all corners of the world (20+ countries) we were present in \u2013 to get their work done. I felt like a juggler who\u2019s spinning 5 plates. And then people just started throwing more plates at my face. And that was when I realised how much Akshar handles by himself when he is not writing lame jokes on Twitter, or coming up with viral social media campaigns.\nThe biggest plate I had to cater to was the \n2015 Zomato Restaurant Summit\n. Our Restaurant Summits are a gathering of carefully curated restaurant owners, senior marketing professionals, and industry strategists. They are the nation\u2019s biggest networking event for restaurants and F&B businesses. \nIt was being hosted in 8 cities across India, Portugal and Turkey. And I was supposed to build every collateral. One man army. Me. Lol. One city alone would have a few dozen graphics to be printed, sometimes with little variations between them. Not to forget, we were short on time too. The only thing keeping me together was mugs of coffee.\nThat\u2019s just the story of how I created everything in a day.\nAnd imagine when on the day of the Summit, you realise that you have printed the wrong certificates for restaurant awards. Yeah, we had put the \u201cBangalore\u201d under the award certificates for restaurants in Pune. \nF******k.\nThis had to be fixed. I felt like a guy sitting at the end of a gun, ready to be shot at. Somehow, and \u2018where there\u2019s a will, there is a way\u2019, we found a way to fix everything in a couple of hours, and reframed all the certificates. It was an assembly line of Zomans fixing this with us \u2013 but it was indeed the best team building activity I have ever been a part of.\nWe finally pulled a great restaurant summit \u2013 in all the cities. Everything spotlessly accurate and clean. \nI had to take a mini vacation after the Summit got over.. hahaha. I had learned a lot in that one month than in my last job (where I worked for more than a year).\nFortunately, Akshar got bored with AIB and returned a couple of months later while those plates kept moving. I don\u2019t know how many I am juggling right now. But I am determined to not drop even a single one of them. The way I see it, they are all made of glass, and have to be handled carefully.\nI believe that one should find a place to work where they can be challenged every day. I complete six years at Zomato very soon. I don\u2019t believe in looking back to see how far I have come. I keep my head high to see how far I can still go. There is so much to improve. There is so much to learn. So much more food to try.\nI don\u2019t call myself successful either. Nobody can measure success. I just wake up every morning, rub the sleep off my eyes, work-out, and show up for work.\nYou learn a lot at Zomato and I am lucky to remember a lot of these lessons. One of the most important lessons I have learned here is that you and your work are two different ideas. You should never take anything personally. Don\u2019t get attached to your ideas. It\u2019s foolish to get attached to your ideas and lose your objectivity.\nWe should all learn to take all the feedback with a smile, (stab that person in your head), and work even harder upon improving yourself. It\u2019s not about proving to the other person that you are improving. It\u2019s about yourself \u2013 it is up to you to learn and improve \u2013 for your own sake. Every critic should be a reminder for you to get better. \nRight now, I work with a large team. But I don\u2019t see myself as a manager. We hate that word here. Because managers are not supposed to be managers, they are supposed to be leaders. That\u2019s how Deepi drives the culture at Zomato. The biggest example is he himself. A few weeks ago, I was caught up with something else and missed out on his message for an important edit in the messaging on some marketing collateral. It was urgent, and since I didn\u2019t respond, he did it himself. The work shouldn\u2019t suffer because of somebody\u2019s presence or absence. And this is just one tiny example. I can only aspire to be a leader, not like him though, but a better version of myself. And someday, soon, I will."

        "content": "Our Huddle on DevOps and Data Platform was one of the events we have been thinking of hosting for a while now. Organisations in this day and age are scaling at an unprecedented pace, and the need of the hour is to develop processes and infrastructure that can effectively cater to quick and quality development. \nWe won\u2019t deny, this was one of the events where finding the right speakers was harder than usual. That\u2019s also because this specific field is not yet as hot in the Delhi region as it is in the Tech hubs of our nation right now.\nIt\u2019s also that much harder to find quality people who want to take this up as a career in this region. So our Huddle became a good way to help aspiring engineers to learn more about managing large scale applications and data platforms. We felt it was important to learn from various companies which have faced and overcome their challenges on scalability and data engineering.\nThe big question we were looking to elaborate upon was \u2013 how can we establish an on-going collaboration between effective analysis and efficient infrastructure, that eventually trickles down to better customer satisfaction?\nOur learnings from the Huddle\nWe witnessed representation from some of the fastest growing tech enabled  companies Rivigo, Policy Bazaar, 1MG, AWS, GoJek, and many more. The event was also driven by some exceptional individuals and teams, that took us through the journey they have had over time \u2013 \nHimanshu Rathore\n (Senior Software Engineer, Data Infrastructure at Zomato)\nOur first speaker\n \nHimanshu,\n \ntook us over the workings of Data Platform at Zomato and how it has evolved over the years. Talking about data as an essential part of Zomato\u2019s DNA, he focused on how it is not only utilised for decision making but also in powering different systems and services. \nHe spoke about how Zomato\u2019s Data Platform can handle 3.5 terra-bytes of data, processed from over 3 billion events daily. This plays a big part in contributing to the immense enhancements we witness in user experience through Search, Logistics, Machine Learning, Analytics, Operations, and much more.\nAkshat Shah \n(Systems Engineer, Go-Jek)\nAkshat narrated the story of how DevOps has matured in the past 4 years at Go-Jek. In a fast-growing organization, as observed by many, DevOps doesn\u2019t always scale. Hence, a central infra team is formulated, whose core functionality is to create abstractions and toolings for running applications in the cloud, helping developers to solely focus on the business logic. \nHe went on to elaborate on factors that should serve as hygiene checks for DevOps engineers out there, who wish to effectively manage and execute all tasks at hand \u2013 the automation of repetitive tasks, measurement of impact created by each action, and most importantly leveraging the utilization of existing tools to ensure sustainable scalability.\nSuranjan Choudhury \n(Enterprise Solutions Architect, Amazon Web Services)\nSuranjan took us through how EMR can be utilized for processing increasing amounts of customer-generated data in a short span of time, with the least amount of effort and cost expended by organizations. \nHe focused on the ease of attaining results through AWS tools as compared to setting up systems from scratch, decreasing the initial set up time and ensuring the least amount of manpower is utilized for every task at hand. \nChinmay Gupta\n (Site Reliability Engineer, Zomato)\nOur final speaker Chinmay explained how Zomato architects the microservice pattern using envoy proxies. He went on to deep dive into the networking layer functions such as retries, circuit breaking, rate limiting, load balancing, etc, which should be taken out of the application layer for maintaining stability and reliability of the system.\nChinmay stressed upon the importance of sustaining reliability within organizations that are developing at a fast pace. Increasing the number of nines in the uptime portfolio contributes to maintaining developer productivity and ensures that efficiency runs through the workings of the entire organization in a big way. \nOverall, it was amazing to listen to speakers talk about a variety of topics here. Living in the age of technological advancements, what do organizations really want to achieve with the help of SRE DevOps and Data Platform engineers?\nReleases with the least amount of manual intervention and effective collaboration between teams, to ensure swift quality and reliable development.  \nWhat was also great about this Huddle was that we saw a lot of aspiring SRE DevOps and Data Platform engineers in the audience, some who were on their way to becoming one and some who were looking to switchover into this space. Some of them just wanted to learn more and apply these learnings to their current jobs, so that they can do more, more effectively. We hope everybody had some key takeaways from the event \u2013 which will shape their work, and the positive impact their organisations have on the customers in the long term. \nAt Zomato, we\u2019re always on the look-out for passionate engineers who take pride in building scalable systems. We invite you to write to us at trialweek@zomato.com, and spend a \u201ctrial week\u201d with us at our Bangalore, or Gurgaon engineering offices. \nWe don\u2019t like the process of an interview \u2013 and neither do you. In that spirit, trial week is a no-commitment week that you spend with our engineering team, working on real problems that affect the lives of millions of our customers every day. And if you think (and we think) there is a mutual spark, we would love for you to become a Zoman, and join us in our mission of \u2018better food for more people\u2019."

        "content": "Last week, we decided to \nstep in and do our bit\n for those affected by Cyclone Fani in Odisha. The idea was to help in whatever ways we can. It has been an uplifting experience on all fronts for us. From the kind of support we\u2019ve received from our users to the diligence shown by our Hunger Heroes of Feeding India, the past week has been a memorable one. It reminded us once again that we can achieve a lot of good by putting technology to better use. \nIn a little more than a week, we\u2019ve raised close to \u20b91 crore in total. People from across the country have wholeheartedly contributed to the cause. Zomans have also pitched in and contributed almost 8 lakh through deductions in their monthly salaries and incentives. \u00a0All the funds received were channeled through \nFeeding India\n to ensure the people most affected by the calamity were helped. The transparency maintained by the team \u2014 despite the prevalent chaos on the ground \u2014 is exemplary. \nThe Feeding India Hunger heroes worked tirelessly even in times when there was no electricity, network connection or even food stocks in supermarkets to answer every distress call and help the victims. Hunger heroes have identified 10 villages with 50 families each of 4-5 people in the area that need dire help of food, water, medicines and household daily items. \nWe\u2019ve not only managed to feed over a lakh displaced individuals in Kiyajodi, Garipancham, Aarapada, Balipatna, Jatni, Jagmara, Pokhariput, Puri, Maaltinagar and Chandraka but also will be supporting all villages with supplies to last 1 full month to get them back on their feet. \nThese kits will include items such as dry ration, infant food, bathing soap, dishwash bar, batteries, dental kits, candles, mosquito coils, phenyl, sanitary napkins, etc. in the affected areas throughout. We will also be using these funds to support rehabilitation efforts of the ones affected the most.\nWhen we started the HELP ODISHA drive, we were very clear about our objective: participate and make a difference despite the logistic challenges in place. Going deeper in to non-urban areas that are disconnected was a conscious choice we made. If we were going to help, we had to do so without any reservations. \u00a0\nHowever, the work isn\u2019t done in Odisha yet. As I write this, our Feeding India Hunger Heroes along with volunteers from Zomato are still working together on the ground helping people. \nAs \npromised\n earlier, this is a rupee-by-rupee update on how the funds are being used."

It featured a Zomato delivery partner going about his day. The only difference being he was on a manual wheelchair cycle on his way to make his next food delivery. Whoever saw it was touched by his adherence to the dignity of work. And it immediately came to our notice that the person in question is Ramu Sahu \u2013 a resident of Beawar in Rajasthan and a proud Zomato delivery partner. \nIn our book, he is a hero. He has an interesting backdrop too: when he approached us for a job, he made it very clear that he isn\u2019t baiting for sympathy. Being the sole breadwinner of his family, he wanted gainful employment, not financial aid from others. This attitude toward life has earned him respect from our city team and whoever knows him vouches for his diligence and never-say-die spirit. \nBecause of his undying spirit, and because he\u2019s such an inspiration, we have ordered an electric vehicle for him. Convincing him to accept it would be an ordeal, we are sure. But we will make all efforts to let him know that we are not doing this from a place of pity; only from a place of pride and gratitude.\nThis green beauty is on its way to Ramu. \nFrom our delivery fleet of over 1.8 lakh registered delivery partners, we are aware of two individuals who are differently-abled but refuse to let their disability get in the way of their goals. The other delivery partner hails from Belgaum, Karnataka and presently rides a four-wheeled scooter to make his deliveries. We recently shipped him with a smartphone \u2013 as a token of gratitude \u2013 because he was facing issues with his device. \nSince we introduced \nthe bios of our delivery partners on our app\n, we\u2019ve been receiving positive feedback on how it helps our users connect with them on a higher level. In the near future, we will be displaying the \u2018differently abled\u2019 status of a given delivery partner to help sensitize our users. This move, we believe, will facilitate a more positive environment for both the users as well as the delivery partners.\nAnd that\u2019s not it. We are also currently in the process of making our delivery fleet conducive to employing ex-defense personnels who have gone through injuries in the line of duty. The idea is to open up our doors to assimilate individuals who don\u2019t want their physical disabilities to stop them from living their lives to the fullest.\nThe food delivery ecosystem in India is turning out to be a massive business opportunity, but as of now, at a noticeable human and ecological cost. We are committed to making this a net positive enterprise for all the stakeholders involved \u2013 our delivery partners, our users, our restaurant partners, as well as nature."

Well, \nZomato Election League\n has an option even for them. \nHere are the rules: \nJust like predicting the winner of the match in the recently concluded Zomato Premier League (ZPL), users will get to predict the next PM of India.\nUsers will get a base 40% discount every time they order and 30% cashback if their predictions are true.\nAnyone can order and predict as many times until 22nd May and will get cashback for the number of times their predictions are true.

        "content": "People visit restaurants to have a good time, in a welcoming ambience with great food. And most restaurants go out of their way to please their customers because they know word-of-mouth and repeat visits make all the difference. \nRecently, we were made aware that a few Zomato customers feel unwelcome at a handful of restaurants because of their sexual orientation. This really bothers us. \nNot only is this against India\u2019s anti-discriminatory laws, and especially against members of the LGBTQIA community, it goes against Zomato\u2019s core values where there is no place for prejudice and intolerance.\nWe are also glad that our customers care enough to want to engage with us on this issue, and show us how much they want us to try and address larger issues they face out there.\nSo, here is what we are doing.\nA week ago we rolled out a new tag, \u201cLGBTQIA Friendly\u201d on our app. \nThis tag will be visible on individual restaurant pages and, through this, we hope to bring a positive change in the attitude of the away-from-home food sector across the country. This, however, does not mean that those who don\u2019t have it, are discriminatory. It might simply mean, they have chosen not to have the tag for a variety of reasons and that is their right, too. \nThe tag is now live in six cities (Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune) and we are going to roll it out in coming weeks and months to other cities in India. \nFor a Zomato app user, this is what it looks like:\nOur team will actively engage with restaurateurs to help sensitize them to how some current and potential customers feel about their practices, and also educate them about the significance of having an \u201cLGBTQIA Friendly\u201d tag on their Zomato pages. \nAccording to estimates by Out Now Consulting, the Paris-based marketing firm, India is home to some 56 million LGBT+ adults. The World Bank estimates that homophobia costs India $31 billion annually.\nBut this isn\u2019t just about good business either. It is about doing what is right, about changing both hearts and minds. One day, soon, we hope that tag is entirely redundant. In the meantime, Zomato will lead by example. Our mission is \u2018Better food for more people\u2019 \u2013 and that, we believe, has to come without any conditions."

        "content": "It was probably sometime in 2013-2014, that I started using Zomato, a lot more than people around me would have liked. The criteria to go to a restaurant was now driven by a single data point: the rating of the given restaurant on Zomato. \nIn practice, this meant that I wouldn\u2019t step in a restaurant that rated less than 4\n.\n So my love for Zomato was evident to anyone who knew me or spoke to me for 30 minutes. \nCut to 10th May, 2017 \n\u2013 I walk in to the Zomato office on the 22nd floor, in One Horizon Center in Gurgaon. I was joining the Delta Team at Zomato and it was the kind of a role where the name itself was the hook. Delta team. This team was supposed to be \nthe\n delta \u2013 in groundbreaking ideas, new revenue streams, and anything and everything that could disrupt Zomato from within Zomato. In my head, this was it. I was going to work in a super exciting role for a brand that I resonated so well with. Except, on my first day, I was told that the team that I was hired for no longer existed!\nThis was probably my first taste of Zomato. \nMy first lesson on life at Zomato. And probably, a great first litmus test for anyone who thinks about working for Zomato. This is not a place for people who like to know what exactly to expect every day of your life. \nThings change here \u2013 in some ways, it is still like an early stage startup \u2013 despite operating at the scale that it does. \nOver time, I have only become more comfortable with change. Change pushes you out of your comfort zone. Change eliminates baggage. Change brings in fresh perspectives. Change is the necessary ingredient for reinvention. \nEveryone who thrives at Zomato, is very comfortable with not only the notion of change, but also the pace of change. If it\u2019s not for you, it\u2019s not for you. We are all wired differently. \nCut to now \u2013\u00a0\nIt\u2019s been two years for me at Zomato. And we are a different organisation than what we were back then \u2013 only for the better. And during this time, I have been able to work in at least four different teams, across several projects, dealing with fundraising, new product launches, evaluation of selected companies for acquisition and/or partnerships, product features, recruitment, cost planning and optimization, driver engagement and benefit programs, restaurant performance improvement and retention, customer loyalty and NPS, user research for new and existing products, org restructures etc\u2026 and I am sure I am missing a few things here. \nAnd in this time period, having been given the opportunity to work on so many different aspects, I ended up winning an award, earning a few mentors and friends and more importantly, accumulating some lifelong learnings. I want to share some of these learnings with you today.\nCaveat: \nSharing my learnings wasn\u2019t a spontaneous thought. \nProbably because I am not too much of a writer and I think I suck at writing. Deepi was the one who encouraged me to share my experience with everyone. I wasn\u2019t very comfortable at first. And that was the reason he said I must. Some people love him for doing this, others hate him. Again, we are all wired differently.\nAnd this again, is a very Zomato thing \u2013\n you are expected to do things that make you uncomfortable.\n You are pushed into the deep end and asked to find your way out. You might hate it first \u2013 but if and when you do find your way, you feel that you are capable of much more. And that feeling is the best feeling in the world. It grows your self-confidence like nothing else can.\nMy other big learning is that mistakes are okay. As long as they are well-intended.\nThis is also one of the quotes on our office wall. \nAnd it takes a minute to understand it. Maybe two. But it is extremely reflective of the culture at Zomato. \nSome context \u2013 before working with Zomato, I had worked in a consulting firm. Zero defect was one of our core guidelines \u2013 that\u2019s how we operated there. I was trained to think that way. There was negligible tolerance for mistakes \u2013 and understandably so. However, things don\u2019t always work out the way you want them to. People fail, products fail, strategies fail, teams fail and even leaders fail. It is up to the organization to create a culture that either embraces or rejects mistakes and failures. \nOn the contrary, Zomato is a place where everyone is encouraged to take \nrisks\n. And sometimes these risks don\u2019t create the most desirable outcomes. And at these times, Zomato doesn\u2019t hold out a stick to tell you that \nyou\n were wrong. It allows you to heal your own way, till you recover and contribute with more rigour to the organisation, enriched with your learnings.\nMy other big learning \u2013\u00a0Your background (age, gender, qualification) does not decide how well you do here. \nYou\n do. \nZomato has leaders who are in their early twenties. Deepi has a team that comprises of more females than males. Some of the product managers are not even engineers, let alone study from IIT. The most important product person in the team (according to me) is a 25-year-old-girl \u2013 who has no background in product/engineering.\nThere is no other organization that bleeds meritocracy and ownership the way Zomato does. If you want to do more, and you want to contribute to the organisation, there is no way it cannot happen. Unless you don\u2019t want to. \nThere is absolutely no glass ceiling. I don\u2019t think there is any kind of ceiling. In fact, there is a room in Zomato that defines the limit for everyone who works at Zomato. It is called sky \ud83d\ude42 \nAnother learning \u2013 pixels and pictures\nThe reality is that organisations like Zomato are not what they are because they just had a great idea. They are what they are because they did a bloody good job executing it. Everyday. Every hour of the day. And every minute of the hour. A marketing copy with a spelling error, might seem trivial to you and me, but it makes our user question the credibility of the brand, and hence matters to us. Every copy gone wrong, every order delayed, every bad customer support experience. Everything matters. These are the pixels that have the potential to spoil the picture.\nSpeed and quality are \nnot\n two opposite ends of the spectrum\nHave worked on products that were conceptualised and hit the ground in less than a few weeks. And they worked, despite the unimaginable speed at which they were launched.\nThings do take time. But in an environment, where things are changing constantly, sometimes time is a luxury. If you have it, great. Other times, you just run faster. \nCase in point \u2013 Public companies usually take a month or two to publish their annual reports. We published ours (unaudited) within five days of closing of the financial year \u2013 and I have read feedback online on how it was one of the most innovative and easily understood annual reports ever. A well-respected investor emailed us saying we are setting the bar very high \u2013 even for public companies. More importantly, we didn\u2019t have to publish the annual report. As an organisation, we see enough examples of hitting the bull\u2019s eye on both speed and quality simultaneously on a regular basis. You don\u2019t have to compromise one to get the other. \nAttaching yourself to effort is natural, but wasteful. \nI have worked on projects that never saw the light of the day, because the context eventually changed or they were no longer relevant. If you put in a lot of effort and time into something, it is natural to feel disappointed when it does not materialise. But detaching oneself from effort and attaching yourself to result is one of my most critical takeaways from Zomato. \nThe sunk cost fallacy \n(making decisions on the basis of past investments)\n is one of the most real challenges to deal with. Just because someone put two months into something, doesn\u2019t mean that it is the right thing for the business to continue doing. I still sometimes find it hard to practice this in reality and find others around me struggling as well. But the faster you learn this, the easier it becomes to take the right decisions, which are for the long-term good of the organization. \nAn observation \u2013 when you ask most folks who have been with Zomato for a year or longer about their experience, a common response is that it doesn\u2019t feel like just one or two years. Somehow, it feels that we have been with Zomato much longer, almost forever. \nWhich brings me to another important learning: \ntime spent in an organisation is the wrong data point to evaluate your ownership, learnings or value to an organisation\n. It\u2019s a proxy. Half a decent proxy. \nAt organizations driven by culture, only a couple of years can give you learnings worth a lifetime."

This directly points to the time it took to make a change, build the project and deploy updates to the device with our bottleneck being the total build time. \nHow did our metrics look before?\nIncremental builds\u200a\u2014\u200a\n80 seconds\nClean builds\u200a\u2014\u200a\n170 seconds\nCold starts\u200a\u2014\u200a\n200 seconds\nWe definitely had to improve these numbers across the board if we wanted to move fast in our development cycles.\nHow did we optimise our build time?\nThe first step for us was to make sure our project settings were optimally configured for Debug environments. This would entail \u2013\nAvoiding building \ndsyms (debug symbols) \n\u2013 which\n \nis a trade-off between having symbols available while debugging and compile time. You can configure this under project settings in Xcode\nSetting \nCompilation Mode\n to \nIncremental \nand \nOptimisation Mode\n to \nOn\nBuilding for \nactive architectures\n only when compiling our project\nMoving forward we made the following amendments to our project to improve build times\u200a:\nMinimising run script phases\u200a\u2014\u200a \nReduced run script phases with clearly defined inputs and outputs\nNew Build System\u200a\u2014\u200a\n Enabled the new build system in Xcode, which provides a ludicrous speedup of up to \n80%\n on incremental builds\nPre-built Frameworks\u200a\u2014\n\u200aPrevented re-compiling third party source by using pre-built dynamic frameworks/libraries\nModular Frameworks\u200a\u2014\u200a\nSplit up bloated internal frameworks and libraries to improve parallelisation \nSuccinct Framework Headers\u2014 \nSpecified correct access modifiers for all classes, structs and enums across all our internal frameworks\nRemove Unused Source Code\u2014 \nRemoved files being compiled which are not invoked from the current codebase\nWhat did we achieve?\nThe resulting build time after following through looks something like this\u200a:\u200a\nIncremental builds\u200a\u2014\u200a\n0.8 seconds\nClean builds\u200a\u2014\u200a\n81 seconds\nCold starts\u200a\u2014\u200a\n95 seconds\nThat\u2019s a \n99% decrease\n in incremental build time and more than a \n50% reduction\n for a cold start.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the build time before and after our changes \u2013 \nFor us, not only did build time decrease significantly due to the action points listed above, but we also managed to reduce our app size by\n 6MB \nand our launch times by \n400ms\n, bringing this under a second on most modern iPhones.\nCare for some profiling tips? \nFew tricks you can use to help with visibility when tackling compile times in Xcode\u200a\u2014\u200a\nSwift function compile times can be measured by setting \n-Xfrontend -warn-long-function-bodies=100\n, where the value 100 indicates a cap of 100ms to compile\nYou can tell Xcode to log build times in the status bar using the following command\ndefaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode ShowBuildOperationDuration -bool YES\nBuild with timing summary is an option you can choose\n Product-> Perform Action -> Build\n \nwith timing summary\n, which will let you see the time taken to compile source files and process execution when Xcode builds your project\nReferences\nWWDC has some really great videos about how Xcode builds your project, which are definitely worth checking out \u2013\nBehind the Scenes of the Xcode Build Process \u2013 WWDC 2018 \u2013 Videos \u2013 Apple Developer\nBuilding Faster in Xcode \u2013 WWDC 2018 \u2013 Videos \u2013 Apple Developer"

        "content": "Everybody loves good food. The staggering ordering-in numbers we see every day, not just in Tier 1 cities but across India, are a testimony to food accompanying every occasion in the Indian home. \nFood delivery has also expanded a lot with \u2018virtually\u2019 every restaurant delivering to your doorstep offering the greatest convenience (while hat-tipping the laziest amongst us). Simply put, users are spoilt for choice. But when we choose to have our favourite food delivered to our doorsteps, we\u2019re often guilty of seldom having the time or bandwidth to acknowledge the person showing up with the package (and a smile). After all, nobody wants to wait a second longer than necessary, to dig into their favourite food. To me, this behaviour is quite unforgivable because, at the end of the thread, it\u2019s the countless people sporting bright red t-shirts who make sure our users have the finest experience.\nOn our part, we are guilty of not reinforcing just how much trust and pride we have in our delivery fleet and the work they put in to further our mission of \u2018better food for more people\u2019. We\u2019ve been sifting through our data mines to bring to life their stories, dreams and aspirations. You can follow \n#30citiesin30days\n across Instagram and Twitter to get a small sense of the thousands who help deliver food to your doorstep.\nYou\u2019ve probably also noticed that as soon as a delivery partner has been assigned to a user, the Zomato app features a short bio. This information is fed into the system during onboarding and usually contains a line about each individual (where they are from, the number of languages they speak, etc.) followed by a line about their goals (educational, marital, worldly, etc.). \nEveryone grows up with dreams and aspirations for what they want to achieve someday \u2014 things they want to buy, career goals, education milestones. Turns out 52% of our fleet harbour the dream of owning a car someday; amazing when you take into consideration we have 1.8 lakh delivery partners registered with us! This is followed by those (16%) who wish to own a house someday, followed by 5% wanting to own a motorbike rather than using rented/borrowed ones. The travel bug spares no one \u2014 4% of our fleet hopes to travel abroad at least once in their lifetime while 2% have no desire to own a passport as they\u2019d prefer to travel across India at least once.  \nAlthough Zomato caters to all age categories, we are considered youth-centric. And sure enough, our fleet is representative with an average age of twenty-five. Our delivery services are currently present in 250 cities, so the chance of a person in their 20s delivering your food is pretty high. \nOf our entire fleet, 20% have completed 10th grade, 37% have completed 12th grade, 19% have an undergraduate degree while 4% are postgraduates. Roughly 9% have diplomas in various courses and only 8% haven\u2019t completed 10th grade. Fifteen per cent of our fleet wishes to complete their education; most of them are either enrolled in long-distance courses or are studying part-time. \nWhat\u2019s amazing is that one in every three delivery partners has a degree or a diploma. \nThese figures are a testimony to two things; the importance placed on education and the adoption of this profession as a stairway to achieving dreams. They also underline that \npeople across age, gender, education levels and geographies are embracing the gig economy. \nWe\u2019ve always made sure our delivery partners have the freedom to choose their work hours. This independence has made them one of the most diligent groups of people we work with. Eighty-three per cent of delivery partners are the sole earners in their families. Our data sets also show that family dependency is the highest in Tier-3 cities followed by Tier-2. Moreover, 54% of our delivery fleet are operating from Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities whereas 46% are active in Tier-1 cities. Delhi NCR tops the chart with ~30,000+ delivery partners, contributing to almost one-sixth of our overall fleet. \nRight now, only 1% of our fleet constitutes female delivery partners. We\u2019re actively working to encourage more participation that will see a breakthrough in the not-so-distant future. What\u2019s heartening, however, is the \nstory of Harshika Pandya, a delivery partner in Surat\n who has been working since the age of 19 years. She believes every woman has a mission to do something in her life beyond just being \u2018behind-the-scenes\u2019. As Zomato expands to new cities every week in its pursuit of connecting more users to great food, the number of delivery partners across India will only increase. We are learning along with them that delivery jobs are an important gateway to many of their core needs as well as their dreams."

The scale of destruction has been heartbreaking \u2013 to say the least. But then, there are things that aren\u2019t within our control and there are things that are. We can\u2019t avert a furious cyclone but we must help others pick themselves up with whatever little we can. \nMost families in the villages have exhausted all their food stocks. The demand for immediate supply of food and other basic materials is growing louder but officials are unable to meet it. With this mindset, we\u2019ve been actively exploring all possible avenues to reach out to feed more and more people in the affected areas. \nIn fact, our \nFeeding India\n team has already reached several villages doing what they do best: provide relief through food as well as basic amenities. \nFeeding India is providing critical food support to thousands of cyclone-affected people who are struggling to get food and water even four days after cyclone Fani. We are actively working on ground procuring and cooking food in multiple locations across the disaster hit districts of the state. Fresh meals are being provided to families who have been affected despite the harsh conditions as well as for those who have lost everything and are vulnerable to taking on huge debts.\nPeople participation\n: \nStarting today, \nyou will be able to contribute food packages for the affected folks in Odisha, at a subsidized charge of \u20b950 for one meal, \u20b9500 for 10 and \u20b95000 for 100\n. To go a step further, you can also volunteer to serve food with Feeding India volunteers in the affected areas in Odisha. \nAt this point, your support is much needed.\nProvide critical food relief directly through the Zomato platform:\nYou will be able to contribute food packages for the affected folks in Odisha, at a subsidized charge of \u20b950 for one meal, \u20b9500 for 10 and \u20b95000 for 100 \nhere\n. The received money will be utilised to procure and cook food in disaster hit districts and served by Feeding India Hunger Heroes themselves. \nVolunteer to take action on ground: \nFeeding India volunteers (Hunger Heroes) are getting together in teams at multiple locations and helping as much as possible. To join them, sign up \nhere\n and take action asap.\nDonate Relief Material to Drop off Points in your city:\nFeeding India is also sending other necessities such as utensils, clothes, toiletries, essentials, etc. and has opened drop-off points in over 30 cities of India. You can find drop off points in your city \nhere\n. Things urgently required are:\nFood Items\n: Rice, Pulses, Oil, Poha, Jaggery, Sugar, Tea, Biscuits and Spices\nUtensils\n: Pots, Pans, Cooker (3 or 5 lit. only, ISI marked)\nToiletries\n: Tooth Brush, Toothpaste, Soap, Sanitary Pads, Bucket & Mug, Washing Soap/ Powder, Antiseptic Liquid, Floor Cleaning Liquid\nEssentials\n: Tarpaulins & Ropes, Solar Lights, Mosquito Nets, Torches and Pencil Batteries\nMiscellaneous\n: Bed Sheets, plastic sheets, Pain relievers, Mosquito repellants, Lighter/Matches, Candles, Scissors, Water purifying tablets, Sleeping Mat, General Medicines\nTo boost this initiative, as we speak, we are also working on the following: \nDelivery partners\u2019 participation: \nWe are proud of our 1.8 lac registered delivery partners and a lot of them have shown enthusiasm in contributing to the cause. I have always had the utmost confidence in our fleet\u2019s empathy and am humbled by the prospect of collecting more than \u20b98 lacs from our delivery partners alone. \nZomans\u2019 participation\n: There are currently 5000 people who proudly call themselves zomans and we are keen on ensuring each one of us has the opportunity to contribute to the relief program in place. We are aiming to collect over \u20b950 lacs through this effort. \nPayout to DPs\n: Due to the devastating circumstances last week, our delivery partners in Odisha (Bhubaneswar, Puri and Cuttack) weren\u2019t able to work. And a majority of them depend on their weekly wages to run their homes. To compensate the financial loss, we\u2019ll be matching their last-to-last weeks\u2019 payout and crediting the amount directly into their respective bank accounts. \nAll these contributions will be directed to Feeding India, who, with the help of its on-ground Hunger Heroes, will ensure food and relief reaches the most. \nFeeding India will identify cyclone-affected areas in the state \nThe non-profit will prepare freshly cooked food in its kitchens or partner restaurants \nHunger Heroes will conduct food drives across all affected areas \nOnce the relief program ends, an Impact Report mentioning the number of meals served, people helped and areas covered served will be shared with every single contributor \nAs a matter of transparency, we will publish a rupee-by-rupee account of where these funds were utilized and the resulting impact, on this very blog.\nLastly, these are tiny steps taken by us to help those devastated in Odisha. We are fully aware of the magnitude of destruction Cyclone Fani has caused and we hope that we can amplify our efforts and respond with even greater clarity as we get more information from the ground."

        "content": "We hope that you got a chance to attend our Android Huddle we hosted recently. Huddle by Zomato is an event that is focused on building a stronger tech community in the Delhi region.\nTech is the background of every component of Zomato. As is true for all other fields, technology cannot develop if we are unable to make an effort to explore, learn from others\u2019 experiences, and exchange ideas.\nKeeping that in mind, we re-started Huddle, a tech and product focused community event. This time, we chose the theme Android; and the Android Developers Group in Delhi NCR helped us put together our fourth Huddle.\nSixty-four people from the Android community spent the day sharing delicious ideas about \u201ccupcake\u201d and other sweetly baked goods. \ud83d\ude09\nNeedless to say, we hosted this event about dessert labeled versions at the Zomato HQ Cafeteria. Obviously; we are a food company after all.\nA number of folks from various companies were present \u2013 Airtel, Lava, Nokia, UrbanClap, Coding Blocks, Samsung, Policy Bazaar, OYO and many more.\nNow, what is a community without experts? Our speaker line-up included \u2013 \nPrashant Malik\n (Technical Advisor, Zomato)\nThe genius co-creator of Apache Cassandra shared his experiences with the group. He is a role model in the tech community, and it was great to hear what he had to say about building scalable systems \u2013 across platforms. \nSajal Gupta\n (Android Developer, Zomato)\nSajal led a talk on solving a problem of human dependency for image classification using machine learning. The talk focused on a case study from a recent Zomato implementation. By reducing human dependency not only did Zomato become more efficient, but we also saw an improvement in the accuracy of our models.\nArnav Gupta\n \n(Android Developer, Zomato)\nTaking the time to perform a comparison of development tools \n(Kotlin, Nativescript and Flutter)\n, and then providing an easy way to decide which one to pick, Arnav showcased we can make an informed choice, based on the type of problem/project at hand.\nAvninder Singh & Arnav Bose \n(Android Developers, Zomato)\nThe last and final talk by \nAvninder Singh\n and\n Arnav Bose\n, not only delved into what leads to the creation of complex animations but also, how these can be achieved as quickly as possible. By diving deep into the usage of Outline and Motion Layout, they showcased new ways to create custom shapes and enhance animations.\nWhat we saw at Huddle was not merely a few like-minded folks coming together, but people who were ever-ready to help and inspire through their knowledge on the subject. Additionally, it\u2019s always good to learn, gain different perspectives and feed off that knowledge going forward.\nIn an effort to constantly develop and grow our community, we will continue to host the Huddle at Gurgaon. \nFor any queries, do reach out to us at \nhuddle@zomato.com\n and stay tuned to our social handles for more updates!"

        "author": "Mohit Gupta",
        "content": "We see our team in red every single day, delivering food to our ever increasing number of users across the nation.\nOver the past couple of years, the number of delivery partners who have become a part of the Zomato family has considerably increased. We kickstarted with 1.8k delivery partners in September 2017 and are now at 180k+ partners, who earn their bread and butter by delivering food to our users.\nIt\u2019s not only important for us to constantly motivate our fleet, but also keep them informed on how they\u2019re doing on a real-time basis. In a generation consumed by impatience, instant gratification is a magical way of motivating someone, be it through words or actual benefits we receive from any sort of service or transaction.\nThe basic problem statement we are battling with is, how can we enhance rider motivation without hurting consumer experience or even better, by enhancing it?\nHow do real-time tip views work?\nCurrently, when our users tip their delivery partners, it only reflects on their payout at the end of every week. In our new update, our partners will get notified at the time of tipping itself.\nMoreover, we are also looking to enhance the user experience by giving our delivery partners an option of thanking our users for tipping them.\nEvery user who tips is keen to know whether their delivery partner is happy about this and whether they, in some way have managed to make their day better. A smile on their face or a simple thank you from them can definitely make a user feel great about this action and can also reward them for treating delivery partners better.\u00a0\nOur basic thought process was to ignite a repetitive dopamine release by letting delivery partners know when they are receiving a tip, on an order that they need to accept, are currently delivering, or have delivered.\nWhat do we really achieve with this update?\nWe will motivate our delivery partners to improve their service at every step of the way\nWe will feed user curiosity of knowing whether their simple act of kindness has made a difference to someone\nTo better food for more people."

        "content": "\u2013\u2013 Update to the original blog \u2013\u2013\nThe word is spreading out amongst our delivery partners and they are encouraging their peers to send their children to \u092a\u093e\u0920\u0936\u093e\u0932\u093e. One of our partners said, \u201cI will work as hard as I can and I do that already but today it feels fulfilling to be a part of Zomato because my children are being taught like their own. I feel it\u2019s my other family\u201d. A couple of them even shared their child\u2019s performance in school and have asked to help improve their performance. A few mothers who dropped their children to the Zomato office were extremely happy to see the warmth each volunteer provided to their children. We are also grateful to three non-Zomans (Mansi Joshi, Nanisha Singh and Amit Baliga) who took out time to teach the children.\n\u2013\u2013 End of update \u2013\u2013 \nA couple weeks ago I joined a training session for our delivery partners, at our headquarters in Gurgaon. This session was being conducted at our office cafeteria. I was there to meet with some of the newest members of our ever expanding last mile delivery fleet. \nWhile there, \u00a0I started talking to one of our riders about his life. I asked him about his kids, and which school they went to. This rider told me he has two children \u2013 a \u00a0girl and a boy. Both of them (10 and 9 years of age) go to the same school. I asked him if his children had ever interacted with a computer. He said no. I asked him if they enjoy school, he said yes. But he wished he could provide for better education for his kids. \nPost our chat, I looked around at the massive cafeteria space (it\u2019s built for the 800 people in our Gurgaon HQ). And drawing inspiration from the great work the folks at \nFeeding India\n and \nRobin Hood Army\n do \u2013 I thought\u00a0we should open up the cafeteria space on the weekends to teach our delivery partners\u2019 kids. Some of them are really bright, but don\u2019t have either the exposure, or the opportunity to be able to fulfil their potential. Some probably only need to be inspired to believe that they can create a future that they choose for themselves.\n(My parents were both educators, and I know what it means, to have great and inspirational teachers who show you the path. It is also my true privilege to have been exposed to many great teachers through my life, many of whom continue to spark my curiosity and send me on new journeys of self-discovery.)\nI quickly set up a chat group with a few people at Zomato, and by the end of the day we had a handful of volunteers ready for our first cafeteria schooling session. Last week, we hosted our first session of the Gurgaon Chapter for Zomato Paathshala. Thanks to Ram, Mohit, Anand, Aakarshna, Srishti, Amrit, Akshay, Tania and Smriti for being the amazing hosts to all the kids who came to our office to learn.  \nThe children absolutely enjoyed the various activities our volunteers facilitated based on their requests. Some of them wanted to sketch. Some wanted to learn how to type on a computer. Some wanted to learn more about Virat Kohli. One of them wanted to become a scientist and spent time reading up on Ramanujan.\nWhile letting the kids decide what they want to learn about, we also had the opportunity to expose them to the arts, science, technology and sports. Needless to say, the experience was truly fulfilling for both the teachers, and the children. Our biggest takeaway was that we all really need to learn how to meaningfully teach children. \nI know this is a tiny first step, and that there\u2019s still an insane amount of work to be done, as well as space in the cafeteria (at our HQ in Gurgaon, and I\u2019m sure in all our other offices). My wish is to see more Zomans volunteering over the weekends to teach thousands of kids, over the next few years.\nEven if you\u2019re not a part of Zomato, but wish to participate in this mission, please email smriti@zomato.com. She is leading this initiative, and would love to hear from you.\nI also urge all other companies to start doing the same if they aren\u2019t doing it already. This doesn\u2019t cost anything, is a good and fulfilling break for everyone to take. \nHere\u2019s my favourite picture \u2014 one of a happy family on their way back home. I managed to grab this one after the session got over."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/the-multiplier-risk/",
        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "There are two kinds of risk in business. Multiplier risks and unnecessary risks. Let me explain both these type of risks \u2013\nMultiplier risks\nThis is when you take a risk which is not-existential; could be large enough, and if it plays out well (a.k.a if it works), then you get multiplier returns. \u2018Multiplier\u2019 starts with at least 2x outcomes. Anything else, according to me, is not a multiplier outcome, just an additive outcome. Now, I am not saying that a 2x multiplier effect is a great outcome \u2014 it is a barely passable multiplier. Relative to a large (but non-existential) risk, multiplier risks should aim for at least 3-5x return/outcomes. \nUnnecessary risks\nEvery other risk is unnecessary in my opinion. You may still take that risk, because you feel like it. I am just reflecting that it is not necessary. Fry some bigger fish.\nAgain, my opinion \u2013 great startups get built when the team takes multiple multiplier risks consistently over a long period of time. Risks which move the needle; in a big way. Risks which succeed, because the work that goes behind these risks is the best in the world. World class execution is the only way to live through multiplier risks. \nMultiplier risks change the paradigm.\nOne word of caution though: the lowest rock bottom of the \u2018unnecessary\u2019 bucket is \u2018stupid risks\u2019. Don\u2019t do that to your startup, that\u2019s not cool. Not cool is an understatement. Don\u2019t be that person \u2014 that un-thinking person who completely misread or miscalculated the downside of the risk vs the upside it can potentially produce.\nIn order to empower your startup team to take multiplier risks, don\u2019t burden them with your expectations. Ask people to just live up to their own.\nAt Zomato, we define our culture by the term \u2018multiplier risks\u2019. There are a lot of people who are empowered to take these risks on behalf of the organisation \u2014 4 out of 5 times they execute so well, you only witness the upside of multiplier risks. In the context of a specific problem, the people who take and execute multiplier risks are called \u2018drivers\u2019; and everyone else \u2018co-drivers\u2019. In other contexts (the roles switch or become interchangeable) the co-drivers become drivers, and others, co-drivers."

        "author": "Arnav Gupta",
        "content": "How much time does it take you to rebuild your Android app every time you make changes?\nHow much time do you think the Zomato app used to take to build for our engineering team? Here are some reference points for you to be able to take an intelligent guess \u2013\n29 submodules\n6400\n java files, \n1300\n kotlin files and over \n17000\n xml files\n~1.2M lines of Java\nWell, here is the typical build time it used to take \u2013 \n2 minutes and 18 seconds. Let\u2019s estimate the huge amount of productivity loss that it used to lead to. A 10 member Android engineering team \u2013 running/building the app 20 times a day post even a minor change in code, results in 10*20*2.18 = 436min = ~7 hours per day of lost productivity; every day simply waiting for builds. That\u2019s huge, and wasn\u2019t cool until we decided to do something about it.\nSlow build times make developers avoid testing on the fly, which resulted in a less stable app for our end users. \nKeeping build times low is important for an engineering team\u2019s fulfilment at work; it also indirectly leads to better, more stable products, leading to higher user satisfaction.\nSo how did we cut down the build time by 95%?\nUnderstanding the problem \u2014 Gradle build profile and scans\nThe first step is to run \ngradle assembleDebug --profile\n to get a breakdown of how much time specific parts of your build take. If you want detailed results of why each step took place, and a thread-wise report of all executed tasks, use \ngradle assembleDebug --scan\n.\nBUD optimisation\n1. Bottlenecks\nIf a project has a lot of modules, it is important to make sure the \ndependency graph\n is created well. It is also important to decide where to use \nimplementation\n and \napi\n when creating module-to-module dependencies.\nIf we have the following setup:\napp -> api(modA) -> api(modB) -> api(modC)\n then, any changes to \nmodC\n will lead to recompilation of \nmodB\n, \nmodA\n and finally, \napp\nIn contrast, if we have this setup:\napp -> implementation(modA) -> implementation(modB) -> implementation(modC)\n then changes to \nmodC\n, will only read to \nmodB\n recompilation\n2. Unnecessary Work\nThe removal of unnecessary steps from the build is essential when making debug builds.\nDo not run \nfirebase-perf\n or \nnewrelic\n plugins on debug builds. These transform your classes for performance tracking and increase Java/Kotlin compile time\u00a0\nIf your development team is mostly using similar test devices and testing only English languages, you can set \nresConfig\n to only \nen, xxhdpi\n, which will reduce resource packaging for other dpis and languages\nRemoving these steps from our debug build \ndropped 40s from our build\n. Isn\u2019t that amazing?\n3. Duplicated Work\nWe noticed that even without a single line of change, the tasks \nkotlinCompile\n and \njavaCompile\n were still running for the entire duration it usually takes in a clean build.\u00a0\nThat made us suspect that the compiled jars are not saved for incremental builds.\nThe culprit? We had fields in \nBuildConfig.java\n that were changing in every build. For example, saving the build timestamp.\u00a0\nChanges in BuildConfig invalidates all the incremental build jars from the last iteration, and also stops Android Instant Run from working.\u00a0\nThe Result\nOur builds are now heavily parallelised, leveraging Gradle parallel processing, since our dependency graph is properly setup now.\nMaking changes to deep-down library modules, that are used across the entire app in multiple modules still takes time. However, now we don\u2019t have to wait for 2 minutes to view changes to reflect for as simple a thing as a padding of a button. \nWhen there are only a few changes to our consumer app codebase \n(without any changes to inner modules)\n, it takes \nonly 7 seconds\n to build.\nNot having ever-changing variables in \nBuildConfig.java\n, in our debug builds, means that Instant Run now works and greatly improves iteration time of UI changes.\nPart of our build time optimisation effort also got us up to date with the Android Gradle Build plugin version 3.3 \n(we were on 3.0 till now)\n. We can now \nrelease our app as app bundles \nand reduce download sizes by 20% for our users."

        "content": "Someone at work last week asked me what my best day at Zomato has been. \nHaving had the chance to work with some brilliant teams and mentors during my time here, I couldn\u2019t easily pinpoint the one day that maybe changed my life or my love for Zomato. Zomato is home and has always been.\nI\u2019ve been with Zomato for five and a half years now, and something that has really strengthened over time is our culture. Being a Zoman is all about going that extra mile. And the work we do to enhance the experience our users and restaurants have with us is not only central to our mission, but also in our DNA.\nI\u2019ve done sales for the most part of my stint here, and I\u2019d be lying to myself if I say it wasn\u2019t the best part of it. From pitching to upstart delivery kitchens, to leading teams across geographies/ products, sales at Zomato will teach you EVERYTHING you need to know about life. \nIf you ask me to force rank between all the great days I had at Zomato, this one instance from September 2017 comes to my mind \u2014 the launch of a product I\u2019d been working on for months was getting delayed, things were probably not moving the way I wanted them to, simply put, it was a typical \u2018what am I even doing!?\u2019 kind of day. Until I got added to this email trail \u2014\nIt was a simple appreciation email from an old client and little does she know the effect it had on me. It was the dose of motivation I was looking for. It\u2019s been almost two years but if I\u2019m ever having \u2018not such a great day\u2019, I always come back and read this email. Knowing that every little thing you do matters, and is appreciated, makes all the difference.\nOh and that product eventually launched two months later! We call it Zomato Gold today \ud83d\ude42\nI started out wanting to share this anecdote on LinkedIn, but after an email exchange with Deepi (below), I\u2019m sharing this on the official blog now. My exchange with him only further strengthened my love for Zomato. No matter what part of Zomato you work with, and who you reach out to, you\u2019re always given the opportunity to voice your thoughts. And for that, I\u2019m forever grateful."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/annual-report-19/",
        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "Click here to download the PDF version of this report. \nThe future of food\nFood is older than civilisation. Agrarian cultivation dates back 5,000 years. The first hunter-gatherers were foraging for food 2 million years ago. It is now the most important part of the global economy and is estimated to be about 20% of global GDP.  \nLegend has it that a soup salesman named Boulanger opened the first modern restaurant 250 years ago in Paris. Since then, the \u2018restaurant\u2019 has been changing our food consumption behaviour. Last year, for the first time in history, people in the United States spent almost as much money on restaurants as they did on groceries.\nAcross the world, restaurants are competing with, and gaining share from home-cooking. Their ability to do so depends on four parameters. These are the very parameters that shape your, and my family\u2019s decision on whether to cook at home, or go out, or request for delivery from a restaurant. We call these four parameters the QAAA \u2013 Quality, Accessibility, Affordability and Assortment. Anywhere in the world, when the restaurant industry improves its score on these four parameters, there is a shift in user behaviour, away from the kitchen in their homes, towards restaurants. \u00a0\nZomato is one of the largest food aggregators in the world. And we play a uniquely important role in improving the QAAA scores for the restaurant industry. \nHere\u2019s how \u2013\nWe impact the quality of food that restaurants serve, by keeping them accountable to their users. We are the de-facto restaurant review and food discovery platform in 19 countries. In each of these, users check restaurant ratings and reviews on Zomato before they choose a place to eat out or get delivery from. A high rating on Zomato not only reflects the great experience a restaurant offers, it also drives further growth through footfalls and higher spends. In several markets, we now work with restaurants to organise third-party quality audits, leveraging our brand to endorse and showcase establishments that adhere to higher quality standards.\nWe improve accessibility by providing instant information. Our food delivery service is also constantly looking to deliver better food to more people from more restaurants, faster than ever before.\nWe improve affordability by making it a level playing ground for everyone. By democratising information we make sure users can make informed choices; and in that way we democratise competition. Given restaurants now operate and grow their business from an easily accessible and transparent platform, they must innovate and cut costs in order to win. Zomato Gold also significantly improves affordability for users, while helping restaurants fill their tables and increase their net profit.\nLastly, humans crave choice. Zomato drives assortment by helping users discover new tastes and experiences across the world. We showcase \u2018what\u2019s new and fresh\u2019 to our users, and tell them what other users liked. Thus, we encourage restaurants to innovate, and give them a chance to act on live, objective feedback.\nHowever, in the midst of all this, lies a unique challenge. Nobody is really looking at the quality of ingredients going into all that\u2019s being served at restaurants (or even at home). The food industry is so unregulated that we are ingesting pesticides and adulterants, leading to increased incidents of cancer and other lifestyle diseases. This is not to mention our consumption of antibiotic-laced meats, which might slowly be setting up our race for a pandemic with the rise of an imminent superbug. \nHyperpure is the big step we are taking towards creating the future of food. It is a clean food supply chain for restaurants to buy fresh and high-quality ingredients. Responsible local farmers and suppliers are signing up on Hyperpure to find responsible restaurateurs who will buy their produce \u2014 without the usual middlemen.\nWe showcase all such restaurants to our users, thus driving more business to these restaurants. This creates a virtuous cycle of demand and supply of clean ingredients in a city.\nWith a majority of the food consumption shifting to restaurants, we believe that there is a unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to fundamentally change the future of food \u2014 a future where everybody in the world is eating clean food, no matter where they are, and what they can afford. \nEverything that we do at Zomato today, equips us uniquely for this future. As the industry standard for restaurant reviews, and as one of the largest players in delivery and dining out, we have unparalleled access to user insights, and relationships with restaurateurs. This is helping us design and scale business models that make this future viable.\nWhy do we publish the annual report?\nYou must be thinking, we are a private company, why would we so diligently publish our annual reports right after the end of the financial year? This doesn\u2019t usually happen.\nTo answer that question, we have to go back a couple of years. The last two times we published the annual report, there was a lot of negative noise around us. We wanted to address the perception\u2013reality gap by sharing more information, because we were doing well, and the external narrative did not reflect that reality.\nThe external narrative used to hurt our team\u2019s morale. But this year, we have been attracting extremely talented people, who are being given the independence and mentorship to become successful at Zomato. Our people are the happiest ever, and have been working their hardest ever as well \u2014 all a testimony to the incredible progress we have made over the last year to sow the seeds for building the new world food order that we obsess about. \nThis time, we are publishing our financial report for three reasons \u2013\n \nAs a recruitment pitch for readers who might identify with our mission\n \u2014 better food for more people. We believe we can never have enough great people working with us \u2014 we are looking for diversity of thought, and the zeal to contribute towards a meaningful mission for the long term.\nSet a precedent for when we go public \nand get everybody who matters used to getting our numbers on our blog, along with a from\u2013the\u2013heart critique on our business. Annual reports also keep our finance team disciplined. We have one of the best finance teams, they juggle several balls simultaneously, and drop none.\nWe want to demystify\n the food\u2013tech ecosystem. While a lot gets written, we are uniquely positioned to tell you the truth as it happens, from the front row.\nLearnings from the last year\nHere are some of the things which stood out for me and the team at Zomato \u2013\u00a0\nPeace is a myth. There is only passion.\nThere are two kinds of people; some who keep seeking peace in their lives, and others who are so passionate about what they are doing, that doing what they love gives them peace \u2014 the kind which you cannot take away from them. We have an incredible bunch of passionate people at Zomato, and they are leading our mission from the front. Over the last year or so, we have put a lot of such people in important roles at Zomato \u2014 irrespective of their age, tenure, or experience. And it is transforming the speed and quality of our work as a team.\nChallenge your beliefs.\nWe used to think that food delivery will only be a niche for Tier 1 cities in India. But then, we decided to test a small town with a mere 150k people. It was mind boggling to see the latent potential of that town; and that taught us that small towns in India hold humungous potential, and now, we have set our eyes on launching in 1,000 cities in India. But this has led to another unfounded belief at Zomato \u2014 that food delivery in India will be bigger than e-commerce. We will prove it right, or prove ourselves wrong.\nSet audacious goals and beat them.\nAlways think backwards from the problem. Last year, we clocked $68m in revenue; and in March\u201918, when we were planning for FY19, we set an audacious goal of $180m \u2014 most of us thought that this was near impossible, but the team worked backwards from there and comfortably beat the goal.\nAlways think first principles up \u2013 precedents/analogies only matter so much.\nSo many times, when something works for other companies in different sectors, we say we should try implementing that idea as well. We say that without understanding what made that idea tick for that company, what the underlying context was, why it succeeded, what\u2019s different about the other sector that cannot be assumed to be true about ours\nSimplicity trumps complexity.\nSimple products work. When we launched Gold, our only premise was that the product should be simple for users as well as restaurants; we also said that we will create a T&C free product. And that\u2019s the single most important reason that Gold has done well.\nThe year of the ecosystem\nToday, Zomato is present in over 10,000 cities across the globe with over 1.4m active restaurants on our platform. We are the market leaders in restaurant search/discovery in 19 of the 24 countries we are in, and have 70m monthly active users on our platform. We have 5m new user registrations and 11m app installations (Android + iOS), every month. \n User engagement has grown very well \u2014 we received 16m user reviews and photos in March\u201919, compared to 4.5m in March\u201918.\nFY19 Financials\nBefore you go any further, please note that all financials in this short form annual report are basis management information systems and unaudited. Also, the financials underneath follow the Indian Accounting Standard applicable last year (FY18) \u2014 which means discount driven promotional cost borne by the company has not been deducted from revenue. That will happen when we file our audited financials with the RoC.\nThis year, we hit all of the goals we had set for ourselves out of the park. Our core lines of business continue to be key contributors, and the new initiatives we\u2019ve launched have started  playing a big role in consolidating and cleaning the food value chain.\n Most of the losses ($294m) are on account of the food delivery business in India. We have had tremendous growth aided by promotional marketing spends to acquire new users and be the first-to-market in many cities in India. In our experience, being first-to-market gives us a distinct competitive advantage in the food delivery sector. \nFood delivery in India is creating an entirely new market; 70% of our regular users in Kolhapur had never tried food delivery in their life (even over a phone call), and Zomato was the first food delivery experience of their lives. All the marketing investment we made in FY19 will bear fruit in FY20 and beyond \u2014 when we realise the LTV (Lifetime Value) of the users that we have acquired.\nWill we continue to invest in growing the market at the same pace? Yes \u2014 as long as there is long term value to create, we will continue to invest and expand this category.\nRealigning our business segments\nThree years ago, advertising represented 100% of our revenue and focus. Today, we are largely a transactions company \u2014 85% of our revenue in March\u201919 was driven by transactions.\nGrowth in transactions challenged our mental models of advertising being a separate line of business. With increase in commissions, our ads revenue would take a hit, and vice versa. In that spirit, we realigned our business to the core tenets of the food industry. We stopped considering advertising revenue as a standalone P&L last year, and we now think of our business as a combination of three key large pillars \u2014 Delivery, Dining Out, and Sustainability.\nWe have restated our FY18 financials in this report based on this categorisation for an apples to apples comparison.\nHere\u2019s how we fared in each of our three lines of business in FY19 \u2013\nDelivery\n \nDelivery revenue for FY19 is $155m compared to $38m in FY18 (4x annual growth). It now contributes ~75% to our total revenue, up from ~55% in FY18. We now operate the service in over 200 cities in India, up from 15 cities in FY18; and we made nearly 33m deliveries in March\u201919 (~7x y-o-y growth).\nOver 100k restaurants are listed in India, generating an annual run-rate GMV of over $1.5bn. ~94% of these deliveries are fulfilled by our ~180k strong active delivery fleet.\nUnit economics of the food delivery business have come a long way. We now lose Rs 25 per delivery, compared to Rs 44 per delivery in March\u201918. Our last mile cost per delivery is now Rs 65, compared to Rs 86 in March\u201918. The key driver metric of unit economics \u2014 number of deliveries per rider per hour has gone up to 1.4 from 0.9 last year.\nImportant note \u2013 some high density neighbourhoods in larger cities are already unit economics positive. So are, some Tier-3/4 cities.\nWith Piggybank, our loyalty program for food delivery, users save upto 10% of their total amount. 2m+ users across 17 cities in India have collectively saved a staggering Rs 260m+\nPeople often tell us that we should open our own branded chain of dark kitchens; so that we can \u2018exploit\u2019 our demand pipeline and improve the margins of our food delivery business. We react to such statements with \u2014 \u201cis that a question, or an answer?\u201d We would rather ask ourselves the question \u2014 \u201chow can we improve the margins of our food delivery business\u201d? \nAfter thinking of various possibilities and scenarios, we concluded that there are far better ways to improve the margin profile of our food delivery business than taking the irreversible step of competing with our own partners (restaurant owners). Some of these initiatives are already underway and are showing great results. In the long term, we stay committed to not competing with restaurants \u2014 and we will help the best food operators build larger businesses in every way we can. But at no point will we compromise our neutrality as a platform.\nHere are some interesting nibbles about our India food delivery business \u2013\nDining out\nZomato Gold has partnered with over 10,000 restaurants globally to offer either 1+1 on food, or 2+2 on beverages, allowing users to get more bang for their buck each time they dine out. Zomato Gold will continue to be a program that constantly provides benefits that are uniquely designed for users who see great value in frequently dining out. \u00a0\nAs on 31 March 2019, we have over 1m active subscribers of Zomato Gold globally compared to 170k active users as on 31 March 2018. \nWe have recently launched Zomato Gold in 4 new cities outside of India \u2014 Jakarta, Manila, Auckland, and Beirut. The number of subscribers who signed up for Gold in the first 15 days of launch in all these cities exceeded the number of subscribers we added in Bengaluru in the first 15 days. This is a testimony to the focus of the Gold team; we keep sharpening the playbook, and every month, Gold turns out to be more successful than before. \nLast year, we also extended the vision of better food for more people to the workplace. Through a digitised platform, currently active in seven cities, \nfood@work by Zomato\n serves 125,000 meals a day, partners with 300 caterers and serves 70 companies. We have also partnered with Tier\u20131 caterers like Elior and Voila to the cash-and-carry segment providing better compliance and food safety. Food@work has revolutionised cafeteria management by introducing more choice as well as an app to simplify the purchase process for employees.\nPeople are increasingly going online to book tables. Our reservations service is now offered in eight countries across 16,000+ restaurants. Over 1m diners in India are reserving tables on Zomato every month.\nWe organised \nZomaland\n \u2014 a food carnival, a first-of-its-kind across the world, in Delhi, Bengaluru and Pune. The vision is to champion the restaurant industry \u2014 and create a showcase of the best culinary talent available in a city to our users. Zomaland hosted larger-than-life attractions, street performances, a stellar line-up of music artists and DJs, along with a dedicated zone for the little ones. Attended by 120k people collectively, featuring over 200 of the best restaurants, it was the perfect opportunity for more people to discover new culinary delights, as well as enjoy some of their old favourites.\nSustainability\nHyperpure was launched in August 2018 to supply fresh, clean ingredients to restaurants. This first-of-its-kind initiative uses an end-to-end technology-driven platform custom-built to provide online access to fresh and clean food ingredients to restaurants. In February 2019, a 30,000 sq. ft warehouse, built to serve 4,000 metric ton capacity per month, was launched in Bengaluru to cater to 2500 restaurants every day. An even larger 40,000 sq. ft warehouse in Delhi was launched in March\u201919.\nRestaurants buying ingredients through Hyperpure are recognised through a \u2018Hyperpure Inside\u2019 tag on Zomato, allowing users to trust that the food they are eating is made using fully-traceable, high quality ingredients. \nWe are also helping farmers develop better crops that are pesticide and chemical-free, providing them assured demand cycles and better pricing throughout the year. Hyperpure is solving a number of supply-chain problems and simultaneously building a more ecological model with plans to integrate rainwater harvesting, and composting for waste.\nFeeding India\nBetter food for more people was a key driver in consolidating Feeding India with Zomato. Hunger and food-wastage are important problems to solve, and what better way to take the challenge head-on than with motivated Hunger Heroes that work on innovative and sustainable programs to ensure all excess food from various restaurants and venues, that would otherwise go to landfills is donated to people in need. Feeding India has served 20 million meals with its 5 key programs including 8,500+ volunteers working in 71 cities, 50+ community fridges, and 21 food recovery vans. \nProgress behind the scenes\nI am very proud of the entire team at Zomato, and here are some of the key people who lead our mission of better food for more people \u2013\u00a0 \nWe also challenged some norms when we started calling Gaurav Gupta (GG), a founder at Zomato. He\u2019s been incredible, and deserves to make decisions on behalf of Zomato.\nThe number of women leaders at Zomato has dropped from 45% to 15% over the last two years. Yes, that bad. We are committed to taking that number up in the near future.\nWe have also doubled the strength of our engineering team, and we are heavily investing in technology which will drive the growth of Zomato.\nNew investors and partnerships\nWe welcomed Glade Brook Capital, Shunwei Capital and CDH Investments as our investors in the past year. Our older investors \u2014 Ant Financial, Info Edge, Sequoia, Vy Capital and Temasek continue to be tremendous partners for us, and we look forward to working with them closely over the next few years.\nWe also kickstarted a global partnership with Delivery Hero, where we will build our respective businesses in collaboration with each other in countries of overlap. The partnership began with Delivery Hero acquiring our UAE food delivery business to remove areas of conflict. On top of that, Delivery Hero also invested primary money in Zomato.\nOur new Gurgaon HQ\nA couple of months ago, we moved to an economical, and nicer workspace in Gurgaon.\n\u2013\nThere are so many popular sayings which highlight the importance of food in our lives. \u2018You are what you eat\u2019, \u2018Food is thy medicine\u2019, \u2018If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world\u2019, or even \u2018One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well\u2019. Food connects people like nothing else. So much so, that Jahnvi Kapoor once mentioned on Koffee with Karan that she would rather use Zomato than Tinder to find a date for herself. \nWe are committed to bringing the best food to everyone; no matter who they are and what they can afford. Over the next year, we are going to work towards making each of our users a brand ambassador for our mission, and will make every effort to provide a delightful experience to our users every time they think of food. \nThis is a long journey, and every day, the energy at Zomato makes me feel like we are just getting started. \nDeepinder Goyal, \nFounder & CEO, Zomato"

        "content": "We take \nfood hygiene\n very seriously and are keen to leave no stone unturned as far as food delivery is concerned. In fact, we\u2019ve been at it for a while now; \u00a0it\u2019s imperative we cover all aspects. After all, consumers deserve to receive food that\u2019s as good as it was when it was prepared in the kitchen. Which is why, going forward, you\u2019ll see the implementation of what we\u2019d like to call \nZomato Safely Sealed\n. In other words, more and more Zomato food deliveries will be completed using 100% safely sealed tamper-proof packages. \nFor starters, these sealed packages will come in two sizes: small and large. The large ones are capable of carrying 2-4 large boxes while the smaller ones are convenient for 1-2 food item boxes. The versatility of the packaging design allows for efficient utilization of the space. \nOnce the restaurant seals the package before it is dispatched, the only way to break the seal is by cutting off the top-end strip. There is no other way to access the food inside, making the tamper-proof packaging trustworthy. And if consumers find the safety seal open, then they are advised not to accept the delivery.\nSo far, we have piloted this initiative in 10 cities (Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Pune, Jaipur, Chandigarh, Nagpur and Vadodara) and the response has been very encouraging, with more than 5,000 restaurants already on-board. So much so, we are covering 25% of our order volume from these cities with tamper-proof packages. Over three million tamper-proof packages have already been shipped to restaurants, and going by the current run rate, we will increase this figure by 3x by April, as we will introduce this packaging across 25 more cities in India.\nOver time, we\u2019ll be scaling up this change, so there is no ambiguity with food safety. We understand that the safety seals are made from plastic however we take consolation in the fact that each package is made from single material polymer with 50 microns thickness, and are completely reusable/recyclable. In the not-so-distant future, we will move towards a biodegradable option. \nLastly, this particular change depends heavily on consumer feedback and restaurant participation. While we all love food, no one wants to compromise on food safety. This is also why we expect more restaurants to get on-board with this development. As a result, restaurant pages will feature a \u2018100% SAFELY SEALED\u2019 message if they have signed up to use this packing. This will help consumers make a more informed choice while deciding where they\u2019d like to order food from. \nWe are thrilled about boosting our ongoing efforts against food tampering with this initiative. And while we fully understand that change often takes its course over a period of time, when you\u2019re heading in the right direction, the effort is entirely worth it."

        "content": "A single thread unites the entire chain of Zomato lines of businesses \u2014 better food for more people. Everything we do to bring together restaurants, consumers, food suppliers and logistics partners, works towards ensuring more people have access to fresh and clean food. As part of our efforts to achieve this end state, we\u2019ve also begun taking steps towards supplying clean and sustainable supplies to restaurants that care about serving their customers with the best food possible. \nThis development kickstarted in August 2018 with the launch of Hyperpure by Zomato. Within three months of launch, we rapidly grew to supplying 350 restaurants in Bangalore by November 2018 (and subsequently nearly 1,000 restaurants, today). This remarkable increase in demand led us to realise we needed a significantly larger scale of operations to meet the growing need for ingredients and produce.\nLast week, we moved from a 6,000 sq. ft warehouse in Bengaluru (able to supply 200-250 metric tons a month) to a 30,000 sq. ft space built to a 4,000 metric ton capacity per month. This means, using an end-to-end technology driven platform, custom-built for this leg of the food value chain, we can now service over 2,500 restaurants every day.\nSoon, we\u2019ll be launching an even larger warehouse in Delhi, followed by launching Hyperpure in 9 more cities across India by the end of this year, and eventually, across our international markets! \nFresh, clean food isn\u2019t limited to hygienically prepared, tasty dishes. It goes beyond the walls of the kitchen to the warehouses from which ingredients are procured, and the farms that grow the crop. \nThrough Hyperpure by Zomato \u2013 a first-of-its-kind initiative \u2013 restaurants now have access to the freshest, most high quality ingredients available in the market, at competitive prices; with consumers benefiting, too. Restaurants can buy everything from vegetables & fruits, poultry (including antibiotic residue-free chicken), groceries, meats, seafood, and dairy; to beverages, and even eco-friendly packaging.\nHow does this work?\nRestaurateurs can download the Hyperpure app (iOS and Android) or sign up on \nhyperpure.com\n and on-board themselves\nIt then takes less than 48 hours to be fully set-up to place orders and receive fresh and clean supplies from Hyperpure\nThrough the app, restaurateurs can search for items, place orders, pay, and even choose credit periods\nAt Hyperpure, we work directly with a large network \u2013\u2013 farmers, mills, producers, and processors \u2013\u2013 and carefully build and monitor our relationships with the source of each of our products. This way we\u2019re able to provide the freshest, most high-quality-produce, while continuing to build affordability, accessibility and convenience around food.\nWe currently have over 100 suppliers in our system; one of whom is Lokesh, who drives over 30 km from his village to transport his agri-produce to a warehouse in KR Puram, Bengaluru. His \nphenomenal success\n with HyperPure has led to over a dozen others who have joined our network, with plans for many more to come on board the platform. \nWhat problems does Hyperpure solve?\nThe primary purpose behind Hyperpure was to help the restaurant industry make better food for more people. Now, we are able to drive transparency and accountability across the food supply value chain, and demand the highest quality produce from our suppliers. For example, Hyperpure only supplies \u2018antibiotic residue-free\u2019 chicken to restaurants.\nWe are integrating rainwater harvesting, and also composting for waste (which is then given back to the farmers). And gradually, we are working with farmers to help them get rid of pesticides, and avoid the use of any chemicals while growing their produce.\nThis is also a first-of-its-kind initiative at scale that is breaking down the supply chain so less people are involved, and more efficiency is created (thereby reducing food wastage). Also, every fresh ingredient that we source can be traced back to the farm it has come from. In some time, when you are eating \npalak paneer\n at your favorite \ndesi\n restaurant, we will be able to tell you where the \npalak\n came from, and when it was harvested.\nServing as an aggregator, we are able to better forecast demand and therefore source on a larger scale.\nHyperpure only supplies the highest quality produce available in the market at scale right now, and we are pushing the envelope to raise the quality of food ingredients being produced in our country. Since only the restaurants that are keen on dishing out the highest quality meals care to buy from Hyperpure, we also help them spread more awareness about the good choices that they are making by showcasing the \u2018HYPERPURE INSIDE\u2019 tag on restaurants\u2019 pages on Zomato.\nIn a world that\u2019s migrating further away from home-cooked meals, trusting that you can order-in or dine-out guilt-free, because the restaurants you love buy fresh, high-quality ingredients sourced direct from local farmers, is central to our mission. And food quality is an endless mission; we will always be 1% done when it comes to \u201cbetter food for more people\u201d."

While we have identified more than a few \u2018bad actors\u2019 on the platform, the fight is far from over! \nOver the past two months, our Neutrality team has removed over 300+ high activity users from the Zomato platform on grounds of \u201csolicitation\u201d (where influential foodies are incentivised or offer to join hands \u2014 \u00a0in some cases for monetary gains \u2014 to write about restaurants), as we gathered sufficient evidence to prove their involvement in these unethical, and sometimes even illegal practices. \nThe time has now come to shift our focus to restaurant owners who also play an active role in promoting solicitation. \nStarting March, we will be aggressively warning users of suspicious reviews and ratings for such restaurants on the Zomato platform. This will done through a two step process \u2013\u00a0\nWe will be sending a warning to restaurants where we detect suspicious activity \u2013 restaurants will have to respond quickly to make sure that all solicited reviews are proactively detected and removed from the Zomato platform and their listing page. \nPost such warnings, if any malicious behaviour continues, we will display this warning banner on the restaurant\u2019s page on Zomato. This banner will remain on the page for a period of three months. \nThis is the first of many safeguards that Zomato will put in place to counter bad actors while placing trust front and centre. We are also working closely with our entire restaurant base to come up with ways to proactively help their business as they work tirelessly to compete in a tough and inspiring food world as well as our foodies who have made our community what it is today. \nHowever, without our users\u2019 help, this move would be a far-fetched idea. So, here\u2019s an appeal to all our users: if you come across any restaurant that promises monetary/material gains in exchange for biased reviews on Zomato, we urge you to share the information with us at neutrality@zomato.com along with concrete evidence (quotations, email exchanges, whatsapp group screenshots, Facebook Groups posts & more).\nIn exchange, here\u2019s a sweet deal for all such vigilante users who love being a part of a clean Zomato community \u2013 \nbeginning March, we are launching a Zomato Review Bounty program for 30 days.\nEach vigilante user will earn up to \u20b910,000 Zomato Credits (which can be used to order food delivery through Zomato) if \u2013\nYou are the first one to flag the restaurant to us\nThe evidence you have shared is information we can verify independently\nThe evidence must be recent or atleast within the last month\nAlso, every week, one vigilante user will earn \u20b950,000 worth of Zomato Credits for flagging the highest number of restaurants engaging in review solicitation.\nI\u2019d strongly urge you to join us in our ongoing fight against paid reviews and help us maintain the neutrality of our platform towards both \u2013 our users as well as our restaurant partners. \nIf you have any other suggestions on how we can increase the sanctity of the Zomato platform, please reach out to us at \nneutrality@zomato.com\n \u2013\u00a0this will go a long way in maintaining a trustworthy platform which all of us can rely on to make better food choices."

Our efforts in the delivery and listings business continue to grow aggressively. Now, with the launch of innovative products like Zomato Gold, Piggybank, Hygiene Ratings, and businesses like Table Reservations, Hyperpure and Food@work, we are able to provide convenient, transparent and loyalty-driven food experiences.\nIn the last year, we\u2019ve launched in over 40 new cities across India, adding nearly 80,000 new restaurants to our base. There\u2019s been tremendous growth in the industry \u2013 the number of restaurants (both of delivery and dining out) are increasing at a very rapid pace. This growth reflects in user behaviour on Zomato as well as people are increasingly going online to make their food choices, and order food, or book a table to ensure a great dining experience.\nWe launched our table reservation platform in 2016, and since then, made great headway in enhancing the online booking experience for our users as well as restaurant partners. In 2018, 10.5 million diners booked tables online on Zomato.\nToday, Zomato might just be the largest processor of table reservations in India. On top of that, all the reservations made through our platform are un-incentivised \u2013\u00a0i.e. without any discount associated with the action of reserving a table. All these numbers are pure, organic and distribution-led traction.\n2018 saw a 60% increase in the number of restaurants accepting online table reservations through Zomato. This spike created more opportunities for diners to quickly reserve tables online, resulting in an incredible 3.5x growth in the number of bookings from the previous year. A key driver of this growth is seen especially during special occasions and big events when large groups of people are out celebrating. For instance, this Valentine\u2019s day, we saw 150,000 diners reserve tables through Zomato \u2014 a remarkable 45% increase from New Year\u2019s Eve just two months ago.\nSo the next time you decide to dine out, you\u2019re sure to be spoilt for choice, as well as have plenty more opportunities to quickly get a reservation made at the restaurant you love."

We launched in 2 new cities in Southeast Asia: Manila and Jakarta. We always knew both these markets would be big for us but the response has been beyond overwhelming. In little over 2 months, we have crossed 100,000 memberships and have over 1200+ Gold partner restaurants. Interestingly, this happened at an even more phenomenal pace than what we witnessed during our India launch in 2017. We are also super excited to welcome Auckland to the Gold family with New Zealand becoming country #6 for Gold.\nThere are many more highlights from the past year but \nThe Golden Act\n takes the cake. In the last quarter of 2018, we hosted 300+ events at 200+ Gold partner venues, bringing in together 100+ artists, comedians, singers and music bands to create a cracker of a show for our Gold members.\nA sincere thank you to every member and partner in all our markets. We promise to work harder and make the program even bigger and better for you in 2019.\nWhile we continue to launch in new countries and continents, we also realise that we have to introduce variations of the product to ensure you\u2019re getting the best out of Gold, in the way that suits your needs. Which is why we continuously ask for feedback from our users and this is what we often hear: \n\u201cI don\u2019t eat out often\u201d\n\u201cI forget to use my membership while dining out\u201d\n\u201cMy membership expired and I did not end up using it as often as I thought I would\u201d\n\u201cIt sounds too good to be true; I am unsure of my investment\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you have a trial option like other subscription products?\u201d\n\u201cMy friends/family have a membership so I don\u2019t need it\u201d\nAll these points got us thinking, so we went back to the drawing board. We\u2019ve always believed that the simplicity of Gold is its USP so we\u2019ve come up with something simple yet powerful.\nHere\u2019s introducing Gold Powerpacks\nPowerpacks are \u2018unlock\u2019 packs that you can purchase based on your dining out habits. And they do not expire. Yes, you read that right. Gold has always been about getting more from life. And here\u2019s much more than expected\nIf you don\u2019t eat out very often or are unsure of how many times you will end up using Gold over a fixed period of time or simply just want to test what Gold is then the \nGold Powerpacks\n is for you. Become a member by purchasing a starter pack of 3 unlocks. This pack allows you to use your member benefits \u2014 2+2 on drinks or 1+1 on food \u2014 thrice at any Gold partner restaurant across India\n.\n \nThese unlocks have no expiry date\n, which means you can enjoy the benefits as and when you want.

        "content": "Nobody likes to see unsavoury stuff in the food they\u2019ve ordered. That not only kills appetite but also makes a user lose trust in the food delivery sector as a whole. Our constant endeavour at Zomato is to make the quality of food better, and make it accessible to more people. In line with our mission of \u201cbetter food for more people\u201d.\nTo help set and improve hygiene standards followed by restaurants, a couple of years ago, for the first time in the world for a food/restaurant aggregator, \nwe introduced hygiene audits/ratings\n on our platform. The idea was to introduce the concept of standardised kitchen hygiene to the restaurant industry in India, and reward restaurant operators who care about the hygiene of their premises compared to those who don\u2019t. \nFast forward to February of 2019 and the sheer acceptance of Hygiene Ratings in the industry is a testament to its rising relevance. As of today, more than 10,000 restaurants have Zomato\u2019s Food Hygiene Ratings displayed on their pages. That figure translates to over 80% of the volume for our online ordering business. Yes, that\u2019s how effective this particular initiative has been so far. Over time, this initiative has helped us reduce customer complaints about unhygienic food by over 92%!\nAs a user, you can check (if you aren\u2019t already doing so) these ratings on your favourite restaurants\u2019 page \u2013\nTo give you a background on these ratings, Zomato operates with accredited third-party auditors. These auditors are experts in the field of hygiene and conduct surprise physical food hygiene audits at participating restaurants. Such audits lay major emphasis on whether a restaurant fulfills various aspects of food hygiene. Factors such as the handling of food, separation of cooking spaces for vegetarian and non-vegetarian items, basic cleanliness, pest control, raw material processing, etc. \u2013 are taken into consideration before the ratings are allotted.\nWe will continue to press hard on this initiative and also gradually raise the bar for food hygiene in our country. All in a day\u2019s work for building \u201cbetter food for more people\u201d."

        "content": "We are in 2019 and there is no way we can ignore the looming presence of climate change and environmental challenges. As mentioned earlier, \nwastage\n is an inalienable reality but we need to step up with creative solutions. The same principle applies to the enormous problem of air pollution, given the role our delivery partners play in the ecosystem. Which is the reason why are taking steps to build a future that creates more tangible value and leaves less carbon footprint. \u00a0\nWe have 1.5+ lac delivery partners with a daily addition of ~150 to the collective fleet. On an average, a million trips are carried out daily by these delivery partners in order to make sure our users receive their favourite food items on time. These journeys translate to approximately 4.4 million kilometers a day. To give you a relative context, that\u2019s more than 11 times the distance between earth and moon. With such an astronomical figure at play, one can only imagine the pollutants being discharged by the delivery fleet in totality. \nSo, how are we going to tackle this monster of an issue? Well, as usual, with baby steps.\nThis year, we started actively introducing bicycles \u2013 both mechanical and electric \u2013 into our fleet. Earlier, this particular space was occupied only by motorcycles. The idea is to not only significantly push the fleet towards electric mobility and cut the environmental damage, but also increase employment opportunities for those who own bicycles. Not to mention the traffic ease in crowded places and smoother navigation in areas with narrower lanes. \nAs of now, mechanical bikes are to be owned by delivery partners whereas e-cycles are being provided to aspiring ones in partnership with bicycle entities such as \u00a0\nMobycy\n, \ne-HIRAN\n, \nTNT\n, \nYulu\n and \nZoomcar\u2019s PEDL\n. We are working closely with our vendor partners to raise the scale of e-cycle adoption. For us, the idea is to convert electric mobility into sustainable mobility. \nWithin the next two years, we are aiming to convert 40% of our fleet to power-assisted bikes. These delivery partners are bound to be allotted shorter order distance \u2014 an average of 2.5 km \u2014 to ensure faster delivery. As of today, we already have 5000 cyclists operating in 12 cities in India, with the majority of the fleet pushing the pedal in Delhi NCR. \nOur delivery partners are a critical part of the online ordering business and their safety and welfare continue to be a priority. Hence, we are ensuring that our delivery fleet on bicycles (whether mechanical or e-cycle) is provided with an ergonomic delivery bag along to ensure comfortability. Moreover, they are diligently trained for the job as well as educated on road safety norms in the Zomato Rider University.\nWe are hopeful about this ongoing development thanks to the encouraging feedback by our cycling delivery partners. After all, the economics is in their favour. Compared to motorbikes, the maintenance cost is negligible and there are no license requirements either, which in turn, increases their employment feasibility as well as earning potential.\nWith these measures (and much more ahead), we remain dedicated to chipping away our environmental concerns while generating employment niches."

        "content": "We love food. It\u2019s nothing less than a cardinal truth for us. Almost everything we do circles around our passion for a tasty, affordable plate. However, our love is not blind as we know that with food, comes wastage. And this particular dilemma bothers us immensely. So, we are already up and running on solving it. We\u2019ve \nposted\n earlier about taking measures to tackle environmental issues with non-plastic initiatives like biodegradable packaging for food delivery. In 2018, we \ncollaborated\n with Akshaya Patra Foundation and ended up facilitating 22 lakh meals for underprivileged kids in less than 6 months. Last July, on our 10th birthday, we participated in a social mission to distribute meals to the underprivileged \u2013 because widespread hunger and malnourishment is painful for anyone to see.\nIn our book, these are active baby steps in the right direction.\nIn 2019, with \nFeeding India\n, we are taking the battle against food wastage and hunger a substantial notch higher. Founded by Ankit Kawatra and Srishti Jain in 2014, \u00a0Feeding India is an award-winning NGO working to solve the complex challenges of food wastage, hunger, and malnutrition in India. Their achievements speak to their commitment and I am glad to point out that, with Zomato now in the picture, the scale of the overall activity is bound to hit a higher note. \nWastage of food occurs in different steps of the food cycle \u2014 farms, restaurants, hotels, supermarkets, events \u2014 mainly because of the lack of a system whereby excess food can be directed to those in need. The Zomato network will power Feeding India\u2019s already existing sustainable models to solve the biggest challenge our country currently faces \u2014 sustainably feeding its 20 million hungry population. \nFeeding India not only donates excess food from various venues including events, airports, weddings, restaurants, corporates, etc. that would otherwise go to landfills but also cooks fresh food through innovative kitchen-models to support people, especially women and children, with limited access to food and nutrition. From a team of two people four years ago, Feeding India has grown to 8,500+ volunteers today, working in 65+ cities, through 12 food recovery vans, 50+ community fridges and five sustainable projects serving 20 million meals till date. \nAs a start, Zomato aims to expand this ongoing movement by activating its restaurants into the network and scaling it through the smart use of technology. We see this association as an important step against food insecurity as both organizations share a common dream of ending hunger and food wastage \u2014 not just in India, but globally.\nMy many conversations with Ankit and Srishti have convinced me of our belief in a common mission, and I am confident that together we will significantly impact food wastage and hunger. In the coming days, Feeding India will become a core part of our DNA and a significant step in our work to ensure \u201cbetter food for more people\u201d."

As we look back, we get the feeling we are certainly on the right track of mixing food with fun.\nThe turnout has been incredible \u2013 over 20,000 people walking through our gates in the first 2 days and taking in all that Zomaland is about. Everyone\u2019s inner foodie has been catered to by the wonderful food stalls spread across 7 zones. A bunch of prizes have been claimed by winners of the various games at the \nCarnival City\n. And, of course, there hasn\u2019t been a dull moment throughout as we witnessed performances by \nWhen Chai Met Toast, Varun Thakur, Dhruv Visvanath, Lucky Ali\n and more!\nNow that the final day of the carnival is upon us, we hope the same enthusiasm is carried through to what will surely be a \u201cSunday-Funday\u201d. The food will be flowing \u2013 so go on and try something you haven\u2019t tried before. There is additionally an amazing entertainment lineup featuring ace illusionist \nKaran\n \nsingh\n, experimental musicians \nBollyjazz\n, India\u2019s top comedian \nRohan\n \nJoshi\n, and musicians such as \nRitviz\n and yesteryear music group of \u2018Aicha\u2019 & \u2018Walou\u2019 fame \u2013 \nOutlandish\n!\nThe overall vibe has been nothing short of fantastic but now comes the time for the Grand Finale.

        "author": "Mohit Gupta",
        "content": "Last night, we came across a video of a delivery executive in a Zomato t-shirt, carrying a Zomato delivery bag, eating food out of boxed orders and replacing each one after resealing them, back into the delivery bag. The video suggests that he consumed some of the food meant for delivery to users, on his way to the drop points.\nWe want our users, restaurant partners and all stakeholders to know that \u2013\n1. We take these kinds of reports extremely seriously and upon thorough investigation, we\u2019ve found that the video was shot in Madurai. The person in the video happened to be a delivery partner on our fleet. We have spoken to him at length \u2013 and while we understand that this was a human error in judgement, we have taken him off our platform.\n2. We would like to iterate that given our multiple communication channels with users, who expect the highest standards from Zomato and highlight the smallest of deviations to us as soon as they receive their orders, this is highly unusual and a rare case.\n3. Unfortunately, this also highlights a real possibility for tampering with the food on the way to delivery from a restaurant. We take this very seriously and will soon introduce tamper-proof tapes, and other precautionary measures to ensure we add an extra layer of safeguard against such behaviour. Additionally, we will educate our delivery fleet of over 1.5 lakh partners to highlight or escalate any such deviations to us, while also encouraging our users \u2014 the custodians of our platform \u2014 to highlight the smallest of anomalies to us.\n4. And finally, our delivery partners are the face of our brand, and the heart of our success in growing to become the largest food delivery platform in the country. Our food delivery business has grown immensely over the last year on the back of our large delivery partner fleet that work very hard to ensure that Zomato translates to a high quality food experience. We thank them and the strong support and trust from our restaurant partners, consumers and investors.\nZomato maintains a zero tolerance policy for tampering of food. This particular incident, while unfortunate, only makes our commitment to fleet training, scheduling and process even stronger. We stand behind our extensive fleet who do the right thing across many hours of the day."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/ios-app-update/",
        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "The world around us is changing fast. And we see this pattern up close in our biggest market \u2014 India. More than one-third of the country\u2019s population has access to the Internet now. Over 35% of the population have smartphones at their disposal with an average mobile data consumption north of 11GB per month. Our platform is also evolving at a fast pace \u2013 our Search & Discovery (S&D) service is currently available in 1472 cities globally while our \nfood delivery services\n have reached 60 cities across 4 countries, including smaller cities like Raipur and Guntur in India. Our user base is getting more and more diverse and so are our product offerings: in the recent past we\u2019ve launched several products, including \nZomato Gold\n (currently present in 20 cities in 3 countries); \nZomato Pickup\n has already taken off in 13 cities. Similarly, we made \nHygiene Ratings\n available to merchants in 32 cities across India, UAE, Qatar and Lebanon. \nPiggybank\n has amassed over 1.5m members and has become synonymous with food delivery experience on our platform whereas \nSneakpeek\n introduces a new way to know more about the brands you love.\nSo, given the fast changing ecosystem we are a part of, it\u2019s only natural that our platform keeps pace with it all. It was the right time for us to re-think how we present our products to the users. We started working on this a few months ago and are very excited to bring the newly designed iOS App to our users. In the remainder of this post, you\u2019ll get some insights into our thought process and how we went about it.\nBefore we get into nitty-gritties of the app, let me walk you through the \ndesign principles\n that we adhered to during the redesign process.\nBottom navigation/Clear segregation of experiences \u2013 Tabs have been provided at the bottom of the app for faster and smoother navigation. This makes it easy for a user to switch flows on the app as and when needed. We also separated our offerings based on user intent \u2013 this should help users navigate the app better.\nImproved search & discovery \u2013 \u2018Search\u2019 gets a separate tab at the bottom for it to be uncomplicated & effortless for our users as they\u2019d be able to search for their favourite restaurants, cuisines, dishes, etc., along with being able to discover other great food experiences.\nPower of visuals \u2013 The human brain can process images up to 60,000 times faster than words. We\u2019ve added a lot more images on the new app keeping the same in mind. And that is exactly what\u2019s going to help you make the right decision when it comes to deciding what to eat.\nSimilarly, we also remained faithful to these two \nengineering principles \nwhile building on the app update.\nAdhering to SOLID \u2013 One of the main challenges of rolling out a new app is the challenge of maintaining high quality engineering standards while still moving at near light speed. Adhering to \u2018SOLID\u2019 principles allowed us to do just that by providing a set of idioms that guided decision making throughout the process and allowed fast paced development without compromising quality.\n2. Decoupling through the use of abstractions \u2013 Another area of focus for us was decoupling highly interconnected components using certain design patterns (Interfaces, Protocols and Facades) among other methodologies which helped us future proof the app to an extent \u2013 we\u2019ll be able to build on top of this paradigm and add features to the App in an organized way.\nSo, what exactly does the app update entail? Let\u2019s take a look.\nOne click, two options\nWe recently introduced the \nPickup option\n to our users and it\u2019s gaining momentum. So, in our latest app version, the \nOrder\n tab helps our users with the two options for online ordering \u2014 whether they wish to get their food delivered to their doorstep or want to pick up food on their own. This particular twist will enhance the online ordering experience on several levels.\nWhere there\u2019s a way, there are more ways\nZomato has always been synonymous with choice as far as food is concerned. The \u201cGo Out\u201d section of the app showcases ways in which you can discover great places to eat out. In fact, users will be greeted by a personalized curation of restaurants, cuisines, and events just to bring out the explorer in them. It\u2019s also hard to miss the visual appeal we\u2019ve added to these tabs \u2013 which makes it a breeze to browse through the options and simplify the decision making for our users.\nLet\u2019s be the royalty\u2026\nZomato Gold has been around for over a year now and it\u2019s much more than just \u201c1+1 on food and 2+2 on drinks\u201d, something we wanted to emphasize in our latest app update. We are introducing \nZomato Live\n, which includes some of the coolest events happening in your city and what\u2019s more \u2013 Zomato Gold members get a sweet deal on those too. The perks of being a Zomato Gold member have never been better!\nLost and hungry? Not anymore. \nThe search experience in our latest update has completely been re-engineered. To begin with, our full screen map view now gives a clearer route to both Chili and Chile \u2013 it really depends on what you want. \ud83d\ude09\nUsers can also search using the often used navigation filters that have been added to the page. We are still testing different versions of the search experience, so this tab in particular might change according to your preferences as you continue to use the app.\nFor the connoisseur in you\u2026\nWe now have a separate tab for profile and users can unlock their dineline to see what\u2019s in store for them on their page. Not revealing anything else here \u2013 login to know more.\nIt\u2019s never been easy to break something down and put it back together, but what\u2019s really exciting is the journey; the journey of making the platform more usable for our users and make the only food app you ever need work better for you!\nLastly, to all you Android folks reading this post, rest assured we are hard at work on getting this to you at the earliest. Stay tuned, it\u2019ll be out soon \ud83d\ude42\nAs always, if you have suggestions on how to help us improve, feel free to drop us a mail at \nhelp@zomato.com"

This feature combines the ease of ordering via the app, eliminates wait time in queues and allows you more flexibility when you need it \u2013 e.g. grab a quick lunch while at work or order that afternoon coffee and skip the queues or even pick up some dinner on your way home.\nHow does the feature work on the app? \nYou click on the\n PICKUP YOUR ORDER\n option\nSelect the restaurant you wish to pick up your food from\nPlace the order\nGet there on time to pickup your food\nIt\u2019s as simple as that.\nWhat\u2019s more \u2013 all the benefits that you are entitled to while ordering online for food delivery \u00a0\u2014 be it Piggybank coins or restaurant offers \u2014 can all be availed through this feature too!\nImportant thing to note \u2013 Zomato is the only app in the country that has the pick up option for its users. Also, we have around 20,000 restaurants where you can place your pick up orders from \u2013 out of which 18,000 are committed to offering this service exclusively with us.\nThis feature is available on our latest Apps across 13 cities (Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Pune, Hyderabad, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Indore, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Nagpur and Vadodara). Over the next few weeks, we will be adding more cities to the list.\nWe are continuing to build on this and you can expect more features that give you more convenience and flexibility to get to your food!"

        "content": "If I were to say that we are running a marathon that has \u201cserving better food for more people\u201d as the end objective, then it wouldn\u2019t be wrong to say that the last nine months have been nothing short of a \u201csuper sprint\u201d in this marathon.\nI am happy to share that we\u2019ve hit \n21 million monthly food orders\n in India. This does not include the orders that are placed over the phone on Zomato. i.e. ~2 million orders. That means as a platform we \nfacilitate 23 million monthly orders, (as far as we know) making us the market leader in the food ordering space in India\n. But who cares about phone call orders in 2018? We don\u2019t. So let\u2019s call it 21. To share perspective on the growth that we have experienced \u2013 at the \nbeginning of 2018,\n \nwe were at 3.5 million orders a month.\nThis upward swing didn\u2019t happen overnight \u2013 we\u2019ve been consistently pushing on all possible corners to make this happen at an unimaginable pace. Now that the first half of the year just ended, we thought we should surprise you with this short blog post on what we have been able to achieve. This is keeping in line with our ethos of being transparent \u2013 we also publish our short form annual reports every year.\nWe were present in 15 cities in India, \nat the onset of this year; \nour food delivery business is now active in 38 cities in India\n. And at the pace we are going, it\u2019s only \na matter of time before we launch our food delivery business in 100 cities.\nThree years into the business, our understanding of the needs and expectations of both, our users and restaurant partners is deeper, and is evident in the growth story on both fronts.\nOur new user acquisition has increased more than tenfold since January. \nNew users that we acquire in a month have increased from \n197,000 users to 2.4 million users \nin this time period.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, \nthe number of restaurants has almost doubled from 28,000 in January to 54,000 now\n.\nSimilarly, there has been a massive shift in the proportion of orders that are self-fulfilled by Zomato. \nToday, 9 out of 10 orders are delivered by our own delivery partners. This figure was a little less than 3 back in January. \nA lot of the credit for this goes to our continued teamwork with Runnr.\n Our acquisition of Runnr and the ramp up of the fleet\n has made a massive difference to the legwork put into our food delivery business. \nIn January 2018, there were a little over 5000 delivery executives. The number has skyrocketed to 74,000 as of now\n and we continue to welcome efficient delivery executives as we expand our footprint.\nBy increasing the proportion of self delivered orders, we have been able to favorably control and impact overall customer experience. The \naverage time taken to deliver an order \nhas come down from \n39 minutes to 33 minutes \nin this time period.\nIncrease in number of orders has translated into a higher GMV, and higher revenue for us. Our \nannualized GMV presently stands at ~$1 billion compared to $210 million in January.\nUnderstandably, the food delivery business has become a dominant part of our revenue model. \nWhen 2017 ended, online ordering contributed about 35% of our overall revenue. This figure presently floats at 65%! \nWe have achieved some unimaginable milestones in a very short period of time. There are some that believe that no one can sprint all the time. By definition, that is not sprinting. And that might be a fair way of looking at things. However, \nwe at Zomato function a little differently; we like moving fast \u2013 in fact, we thrive on it\n. We have been sprinting for these nine months, and we are not stopping anytime soon \ud83d\ude42"

        "content": "Two months ago we launched Zomato Piggybank, a reward points program for loyal users of our food delivery service. The idea behind this membership is to reward regular users, whilst also doing our bit in helping others give back to the society.\nTo give you a brief overview, once subscribed to Zomato Piggybank \u2013 every time a user orders food online on Zomato\u2019s food delivery platform, 10% of her order value is credited back as Z Coins into her Zomato Piggybank. These credits are later redeemed against food ordered from exclusive Piggybank restaurants. Additionally, every time an order is placed using Piggybank, Zomato donates \u20b91 to Akshaya Patra Foundation, the world\u2019s largest NGO running mid-day meal programs for children \u2013 on behalf of the user.\nNeedless to say the reception to this new program by both \u2013 our users, as well as partner restaurants \u2013 has been exceptional.\nLet me share some of these numbers with you:\nOnly two months into the program, we already have a base of over 1 Million Piggybank members. Given that Piggybank was open to only select users (and those who they decide to refer to), the fast rate of adoption has strengthened our belief that users are receptive to new and exciting products. Word of mouth has worked wonders for us, ~30% of subscribers are still coming through referrals. So far over 2 Million orders have been made using Z coins!\nWhat\u2019s more the loyalty program has already saved Zomato users a fair amount of moolah too: \u20b950 Million (so far)! But that\u2019s not it. Even our restaurant partners are delighted to be a part of this program. Piggybank restaurant partners have witnessed a 10% share shift in the number of orders made by Piggybank users. We are finding that Piggybank subscribers are ordering more on Zomato on a weekly basis, compared to the period when we didn\u2019t have this program in place. And this upward trend is providing impetus for more restaurants to be a part of Piggybank.\nLastly, Zomato promised to donate \u20b91 to Akshaya Patra Foundation whenever someone uses Piggybank to place an order. In two months\u2019 time, we\u2019ve managed to raise \u20b92 Million in funds i.e. an equivalent of ~500,000 meals for Akshaya Patra. We\u2019re glad to be the enabler for both our users and partners, as they give back to the society, and help us get a step closer to our vision of better food for more people.\nStay tuned for more on this \ud83d\ude42"

        "content": "Better food for more people. These five words pretty much sum up all the decisions we\u2019ve taken over the past few years.\nWe\u2019ve also realized that we ought to expand our horizons when it comes to what we are trying to achieve. Our ultimate purpose is to ensure better food for more people, and it is equally important to ensure we don\u2019t miss out on \u2018non-conventional\u2019 avenues. For years, restaurants have been the primal focus of our attention and rightly so. But from our recent learnings, we know we must go beyond the obvious. Food also encompasses what we eat in our offices.\nWhich is why I am thrilled to announce Zomato\u2019s acquisition of TongueStun. This Bangalore-based startup is the biggest player in the corporate cafeteria sector, currently active in 6 cities (Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Pune, Mumbai and Gurgaon/Noida). It caters to 1500+ companies which includes a number of large organizations like IBM, Accenture, E&Y, Sony, Genpact, 3M, Mindtree and Deloitte.\nFood at work is an important segment of our overall mission, and Tonguestun is the largest player in the segment. On a daily basis, more than 150,000 meals are provided to office-goers thanks to TongueStun\u2019s affiliation with 1000+ food partners. Over time, we will also include the capabilities of the TongueStun app within Zomato, thus providing another very high frequency use case for our users \u2013 that is to order food for pickup from their cafeterias using the Zomato app.\nSo, what does this development mean to the all the invested parties \u2013 companies which are Tonguestun\u2019s customers, users, food partners, and employees? Well, nothing changes. For all of Tonguestun\u2019s customers, all contracts stay intact \u2013 and again, nothing changes. It will be business as usual today as well as tomorrow. Everything will run as smoothly as it previously did. With more execution muscle, we are only going to provide TongueStun\u2019s users more delight and better food choices. Our increased speed of growth will benefit our food partners \u2013 caterers and restaurants tremendously. The team will stay intact as 100% of the team at TongueStun is being retained in their original roles.\nManju founded TongueStun in 2012 and has been leading Tonguestun through a string of challenges to bring it to its leadership position today. We\u2019ve been in talks with him and his core team for quite some time. For us, this acquisition is about the team, as much as it is about the business. I am excited to have Manju join the core team at Zomato and build out an important part of our business strategy going forward."

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "At Zomato, we care about our users as much as we care about our restaurant partners. Without a balance between these two elements, we wouldn\u2019t be able to adhere to our long-held mission \u2013 better food for more people. However, it hurts us when regulations and hygiene standards are not followed by restaurants.\nAs a result, starting \u00a0today, we are de-listing hundreds of restaurants from our food ordering platform for not being compliant to Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) regulations. These restaurants were not able to furnish an FSSAI license to Zomato. As you must know by now, we take hygiene very seriously; so much so we introduced \nFood Hygiene Ratings\n last year; an initiative that is being embraced by the restaurant community. For us, it\u2019s a matter of taking the right call because at the end of the day, the wellbeing of our users matter immensely to us. As and when these restaurants provide us their FSSAI licenses, we will enable them for online ordering services.\nSome restaurants who were not able to furnish their FSSAI licenses have high Zomato ratings and/or high repeat order volumes on Zomato \u2013 we have given them until the end of this month to furnish their licenses to us.\nThe de-listing of restaurants happened thanks to our collaborative effort \u00a0with FSSAI. Along with FSSAI, Zomato is a guardian of users and the restaurant industry. As a result, FSSAI and Zomato have worked together to take strict actions in the interest of public health. In fact, we are going to make sure that we don\u2019t list any cloud kitchen on Zomato unless and until it goes through our mandatory hygiene check, which is a food safety and hygiene checklist. This hygiene check is conducted by reputed third parties who are experts at this.\nThese measures will certainly help strengthen the ecosystem as it will filter out parties that aren\u2019t keen on prioritizing the users\u2019 interest. Nobody wants to consume food prepared in an unkempt kitchen. Following this de-listing drive, we are expecting an uptick in hygiene standards.\nI personally wish to thank the FSSAI CEO, Pawan Kumar Agarwal, and fully support his organization\u2019s ongoing efforts toward a safer and better restaurant industry in India.\nLastly, Zomato is designed to be a democratic quality controller in the industry. Which means that users are (obviously) welcome to help us in this endeavour. As a user, if you feel that the quality or hygiene of any restaurant/meal you had was subpar, you can/must write a constructive review on Zomato. All of us are well aware that everybody checks a restaurant\u2019s Zomato rating before going to a new place or ordering in food. Unbeknownst to you, your review goes a long way in making sure that only the best restaurant businesses are able to succeed."

Across the world, we offer our users great convenience and greater choice in what they eat \u2014 wherever and whenever. We help them save time, effort, and money. And all this while serving our restaurant partners, providing them greater reach to more consumers, and helping thousands of small businesses scale up faster.\nHowever, we can do more. In fact, much more.\nAn unintended consequence of our business is that as more people order more food, the industry will consume more plastic packaging material. Zomato alone processes 16.5 million orders a month; all the food delivery aggregators put together process around 35-40 million orders a month. These many orders add up to 22,000 metric tonnes of plastic waste created every month in India. And whether we intend it or not, quite a lot of it ends up in the ocean. Much as we care about delighting our partners and our users, we must also care about the impact we have on our planet.\nAt Zomato, we\u2019ve been taking baby steps to reduce our impact on the environment. On our app, we offer consumers an opportunity to opt out of cutlery when they order, thereby reducing plastic use, and also working with our restaurant partners to increase adherence to this feature.\nOn Sunday, Zomato\u2019s delivery fleet drove for 2.4 million kilometers to deliver around 600k orders \u2013 that\u2019s six times the distance between earth and moon. It is imperative that we work with restaurants and users to \u201cpool\u201d delivery routes, thereby reducing fuel consumption while keeping delivery times intact.\nWe are also working with kitchens to help them modify serving portions based on the feedback we receive, thereby reducing overall wastage. Our delivery partners use insulated, specially designed bags that keep food fresh without additional packaging layers.\nAnd as mentioned earlier, we ought to do more. Which is also why we need to do this together. Even as we compete with one another for greater market shares, let\u2019s share ideas for a more effective ecosystem and ultimately, a better world.\nLet\u2019s start reducing the amount of packaging material and while we are at it, let\u2019s improve the quality of the material we\u2019re already using. This long-term endeavour will take time but it will certainly make a huge difference."

A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step. \u2013 Lao Tzu\nTen years ago, Pankaj and I started something which is now bigger than we had ever imagined it to be. It\u2019s been a spectacular journey with crazy ups and downs, and I wouldn\u2019t trade all the learnings and camaraderie for anything else in life. It gives us incredible pride to see millions of people across the world use Zomato to discover great meals, while building a community and helping each other in the process.\nMost amount of growth at Zomato has happened in the last 5 years \u2013 the first 5 years were spent finding our feet, and building a solid cultural DNA which still thrives at Zomato, without any large scale HR process being a part of our daily lives. I am also very proud to say, that today, we have 75 people who have spent more than 5 years at Zomato. Thank you everyone who have spent a part of their life building Zomato. Time is the greatest gift you can give someone, and I am grateful to everyone from the past and present of Zomato for choosing to spend their time at Zomato, as opposed all the other opportunities life threw their way..\nAt Zomato, we have always looked forward and perhaps why a milestone like being around for 10 years has snuck up on us so quickly. Over all these years, our mission has also evolved to something much much more than being a restaurant reviews and food delivery platform. We are already taking baby steps towards being the biggest farm to table food company in the world, and there is so much to do for all of us. So much so, that today, it still feels like Day 1, and a whole lot of us walk into Zomato with the same level of childish enthusiasm we wore when we had just started.\nWe are working towards the idea of a world wherein most people should have access to safe and nutritious meals at the same price or cheaper than the cost of preparing them at home. We want to solve for the need to have to cook vs eat out/ order, and see cooking as something that people should want to do because it\u2019s a joyous activity instead of being a chore.\nThis mission impacts consumers by exposing them to a variety of high quality meal options that are \u2013 accessible to them, affordable, safe, nutritious and healthy; while also helping the restaurant industry grow sustainably \u2013 by allowing a transparent flow of feedback, fostering entrepreneurship, educating the restaurant fraternity and upholding higher standards for the industry to follow.\nTo all our users, our restaurant partners, our friends and our critics \u2013 thank you for being part of our journey, we wouldn\u2019t be here without you. You make us who we are, and continue to inspire us to do better than yesterday, every single day.\nA very special thanks to our investors who have been with us through thick and thin. No company can hope for a better group of people backing it, than what you have been to us. You are more friends and mentors to us, than investors, and we do not take that privilege lightly. Thank you, again.\nThis time, on our 10th anniversary, unlike most of July 10ths in the last 10 years, we are not going to have a party to celebrate the occasion. This year, to make our landmark birthday on 10th July more special, we will be celebrating it in line with our vision \u2013 better food for more people \u2013 by distributing 250,000 good and hygienic meals to the homeless and underprivileged. There won\u2019t be any party or booze \u2013 only spreading smiles all around us. Thanks, everyone, especially Sequoia Capital, all our other investors, and Robin Hood Army for contributing directly and indirectly to helping us make these 250,000 smiles happen.\nLastly, we continue to believe in the \u20181% done\u2019 philosophy. We might have completed 3652 days as a company, but we wish to make even more progress everyday. And that thought makes us happy about the journey we\u2019ve chosen for ourselves.\nHere\u2019s to many, many more years ahead."

That\u2019s right, that\u2019s 10% earned on \nevery single completed order\n! Using these points, you can pay 10% of the value of the next order you place at a wide selection of exclusive top-rated restaurant partners. You even earn Z Coins in your Piggybank when you use Piggybank coins on a particular order.\nAnd this offer is valid along with any other offers running on Zomato. Any restaurant funded discounts will continue to be available on Zomato Delivery.\n\ud83d\ude00 mind blown?\nAnd that\u2019s not it.\nEvery time you order food using your Piggybank, you get a chance to spread smiles somewhere. You\u2019d be able to do this because Zomato will donate \u20b91 on your behalf to Akshaya Patra Foundation, world\u2019s largest NGO running mid-day meal programs for children. Yes, \nwe \ndonate \u20b91 per order. As a customer, you don\u2019t pay, but you enable us to. So you are directly responsible for the good deed that we do on your behalf.\nOne rupee per order is a lot \u2013 if all orders at Zomato were placed using Piggybank points, we would be donating \u20b91.25 crore a month on your behalf to Akshay Patra Foundation. That changes the lives of millions of children in our country.\nFor starters, we are rolling out the Piggybank feature to a select number of users based on their loyalty and geographic availability of partner restaurants (which is about 10,000 users as of today on our Android app). As a joining bonus, all these lucky users will be given 200 Z coins worth \u20b9200. Within a week or two, as we ramp up our partner network on Piggybank, we will extend this membership program to all our loyal food ordering users across India who place more than 5 orders a month regularly. Gold users will also get the privilege of early access to Piggybank.\nIf you are not a part of the launch invitation list which gets access to Piggybank, you will have to get referred by someone who already has Piggybank. When Piggybank rolls out in your area, you will see this if you are part of the invitation list \u2013\nAnd this if you are not part of the invitation list and will need a referral code to get in \u2013\nIn two months, we\u2019ll be converting it into a paid subscription program at \u20b9299 per year (inspired by Amazon Prime). This is when referrals will not be needed and you will be able to buy your way into Piggybank.\nPersonally, I believe and hope that this will a beginning of another beautiful story for our users like Zomato Gold. Needless to add, everybody at Zomato who\u2019s been building Piggybank is super excited about it. And every user that we have spoken to about Piggybank so far, only has good things to say about the most rewarding loyalty program they\u2019ve ever heard about. They have been saying things like \u201care you kidding me?\u201d, \u201cmind-blown\u201d after hearing about Piggybank.\nWhat do you think? \ud83d\ude00"

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "\u201cSuccess is not final, failure is not fatal; it is the courage to continue that counts.\u201d \u2013 Winston Churchill\nAll the numbers in this \u201cshort form\u201d annual report are unaudited. Exact numbers might change in small deltas while we go through the audit.\nFinancial year 2018 (year ending March 31, 2018) was a memorable year for us in many ways. While each of our businesses hit multiple milestones during the year gone-by, if I were to mention the five biggest learnings/achievements for Zomato, as a company, they would be:\nWe demonstrated that our business \ncan\n generate profits \u2013 almost all throughout the year, we hit EBITDA break-even globally, across all our business, and while maintaining good growth levels; and then in the last two months, we decided to double-down on growth (more on that later).\nInnovation drives long term survival, growth, revenue and profit (yes, all the good things) \u2013\u00a0we feel proud of ourselves for getting the product market fit right with Zomato Gold and Zomato Treats. Since launching Zomato Gold a few months ago in India, we have seen unparalleled demand from our users for this product and at ~160k subscribers, we are probably the fastest user subscription program in the country to reach this scale in such a short timeframe. Our waitlist for Zomato Gold is hovering at 500k users right now.\nPeople should be the primary rationale behind an acquisition:\n\u00b7Early 2017, we decided that we need to build our own fulfillment capabilities in order to provide more choice and best experience to our users \u2013 that\u2019s why we acquired Runnr some time ago.\n\u00b7I feel proud of the fact that in a matter of ~6 months, from zero, we now deliver, ourselves, ~60% of the food orders on our platform. Given how operations intensive this particular business is, this growth is phenomenal and almost unreal.\n\u00b7This has far exceeded our expectations and if we are able to execute with this intensity, we would have some fabulous years ahead.\n\u00b7All of this happened because we have a very committed and solid team from Runnr working with us.\nSometimes, people leave. It\u2019s ok. But then, some of them also come back. This last year was very emotional for us as Pankaj, after 10 years of building Zomato, decided to hang up his boots. While we celebrate his exit and achievements, we are also welcoming back a number of ex-Zomans who took a break from Zomato to learn and invest in themselves \u2013 and now they are coming back to where they belong. Home.\nReading helps. The four most helpful books for me this year which helped shape Zomato were:\n\u00b7Leverage Points: Places to Intervene In a System (not exactly a book but a short pdf essay by Donella Meadows) \u2013 helps everywhere. This essay could very well be called Life 101.\n\u00b7The Art of Thinking Clearly (by Rolf Dobelli) \u2013 this is the sum total of all the psychology books you can read \u2013 helped me become a better product/marketing manager.\n\u00b7Thinking Backwards (by Martin Scheepbouwer and Rob van Haastrecht) \u2013 helped me problem solve in a more structured, faster way and get to better answers than before.\n\u00b7Relentless (by Tim Grover) \u2013 helped me easily identify the kind of people I work with. And then identify the right roles for these folks to help them thrive.\nHow did we fare in FY18?\nRevenue\nWe did ~$74m in topline in FY18 as compared to $51m in FY17 \u2013 ~45% growth over last year.\nCost/Burn\nOperating burn for FY18 was ~$11m compared to $15m in FY17; $6m of the operating $11m burn in this year was incurred in just February and March (when we decided to double down on growth).\nOrdering\nIn FY18, food ordering comprised ~30% of our revenues, up from ~18% in FY17. We are now live in food ordering in 15 cities in India and 5 cities in the Middle East. We hit ~5.5m monthly food orders in March 2018.\nSubscriptions (Zomato Gold and Zomato Treats)\nAs on March 31, 2018, we have 280k+ active user subscribers (and growing very rapidly) across our two subscription programs \u2013 Zomato Gold and Zomato Treats.\nAdvertising\nOur advertising business grew slowly in this financial year for lack of focus. We had stopped hiring in our ads business as we really wanted to crack the transactions piece as an organisation. The number of people in our ad sales team is down 20% since last year, but our ads revenue for this year still grew by ~20% y-o-y. ~15,000 restaurants paid us for advertisements in the last year. We have started investing in growing this business in the last month and we are seeing some great results (more on that a few months from now).\nExecution diary from the last few months\nWe have ended the year on a very high note. Our food delivery business in India grew ~48% in March 2018 over the previous month in terms of number of order volume and by ~55% in terms of revenue.\nIn a short period of time, Zomato Gold now contributes ~12% of our monthly revenue. We are excited about Zomato Gold and are very soon taking it to more cities and also expanding our membership base as fast as we can.\nOur ads business is growing really well. We introduced some new products to the mix, and they are being very well received by the restaurant owners community.\nWe introduced a new app version a couple of months ago. All the conversion numbers are up significantly and this update could not have come at a better time because we are investing heavily in marketing the app.\nAs we enter a new financial year, we are extremely excited and pumped and hope we can add more value to our restaurant partners and keep delighting our users in the coming years. We are currently at an annualized revenue run rate of $100m. And looking at the last two months (our revenue in March is 35% up from January), if the momentum continues, we will be recording one of our best years in business. And the team is very adamant to continue (and even further increase) this momentum.\nOver and out."

        "content": "We launched Zomato Gold in UAE to much fanfare in March 2017. Back then, the idea behind this premium subscription program was to offer members limitless benefits on beverages at top restaurants across Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Zomato Gold members in the UAE could buy any drink from the menu and get one free \u2013 on up to 2 drinks.\nWe started out with around 200 top-rated restaurants and bars in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and with every passing month kept adding to, and distilling the list of our partners, while the subscriber base kept growing. At last count, we had over 380 restaurant partners for over 15,000 Zomato Gold members.\nSo far, so good.\nTo mark the first anniversary of Zomato Gold in UAE, we\u2019ve decided to push the envelope a bit (read: a lot) further. Which is why, effective March 15th, every subscribing Zomato Gold member in UAE will enjoy \nadditional Gold access to complimentary food\n, as well as drinks across 600+ restaurants in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.\nThat\u2019s right \u2013 Zomato Gold will no longer be restricted to just drinks. Starting today, if you are a Zomato Gold member, you will be entitled to one complimentary dish at Gold Food partner restaurants, and of course, up to 2 complimentary drinks at Gold Drinks partner restaurants. Easy, and fun.\nAll existing Zomato Gold members will get their membership extended to include food at no extra cost.\nThe new and improved Zomato Gold in UAE now includes Food Partner restaurants like \nKaftan Turkish Cuisine & Fine Art\n, \nWakame \u2013 Sofitel Dubai Downtown\n, \nIntersect By Lexus\n, \nGaucho\n and popular cafes such as \nLeopold\u2019s Of London\n, \nArt House Cafe\n, \nBubo Barcelona Cafe\n, \nCafe Mandarina\n, \nCrumbs Elysee\n, \nTreej Cafe\n and \nMitts & Trays\n as part of this upgraded service.\nZomato Gold is now applicable across the entire menu, and throughout the week. We are also lifting any restrictions on the monthly number of visits per restaurant. You can say that Zomato Gold in UAE is now truly T&C (terms and conditions) free.\nLimitless indulgences indeed \ud83d\ude00\nWe really wish this helps you explore more of the best of Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Of course, when you do that, don\u2019t forget to write a review on Zomato. Everybody should participate actively in the community which gives so much to all of us.\nOne more thing. As a Zomato Gold member, you will also get access to immersive food and drinks experiences such as restaurant launch parties, pub crawls, new menu previews of restaurants, etc. These experiences are being held exclusively for Zomato Gold members in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.\nFor the first 2,000 new subscribers, the service will be available at a special early bird price of AED 59 (3 months) and AED 149 (12 months).

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "It\u2019s been around 3 months since we launched Zomato Gold in India. And needless to say, the journey has been phenomenal so far. During this time period, 150,000+ users have subscribed to Gold and 2000+ restaurant partners have joined the bandwagon. The numbers, to put it succinctly, paint a happy story \u2013\u00a0one which we are incredibly proud of. This couldn\u2019t have been possible without the unbridled trust of our partners and users.\nEven though we had launched a subscription service in UAE and Portugal before, launching Zomato Gold in India was a different battle altogether. We know everything that works outside India doesn\u2019t necessarily work inside India and vice versa. As a result, we made a few calculated bets. And luckily for us, they worked out really well.\nThis \u201cluck\u201d was a combination of (real) luck and some tough decisions \u2013 and that taught us some valuable lessons \u2013 and like we do from time to time, here\u2019s everything in the spirit of sharing back with the startup community \u2013\nKeep it simple\nAs clich\u00e9d as it may sound, we resorted to the age old saying of \u201ckeeping it simple\u201d when it came to creating our product. We considered everything \u2013 giving different offers at different type of restaurants, different offers on different menu items, different offers at different points in time, etc. However, in the end, we went ahead with a standard offer that struck a chord across all the participating restaurants as well as users. The key-phrase while designing and launching Zomato Gold in India was \u201cT&C free\u201d. In other words, we insisted that the product will be completely \u201cterms and conditions free\u201d for the end user. And we were able to achieve 99.99% of that vision.\nQuality > Quantity\nIdea of Zomato Gold was not to get ALL the restaurants on board. It was to get the BEST on board. We defined a threshold in terms of rating and restaurant popularity (basis Zomato data) while prioritizing our partner restaurants. So, from 100K+ restaurants in India, we targeted only ~1%. We did so because we were confident this was the right set. We also tried to ensure a fine breadth of restaurants \u2013 the idea was to enable a user with a good sample to consider for different occasions before eating out.\nThis is what our users have to say about our restaurant partners at various point in time \u2013\nAccidents leading to virality\nZomato Gold was available for purchase on specific days and during specific time slots. And believe it or not, we never planned it that way. We had to impose a limit on the total number of subscriptions due to the overwhelming response that we received. We wanted to ensure that our restaurant partners could accommodate and deliver the promised experience to our Gold users seamlessly. Hence, putting a restriction on the total number of subscriptions was more a reactive than a proactive strategy for us. And the scarcity (again, not by design) led to the product going viral \u2013 which gave Zomato Gold the insane amount of initial success that it has seen.\nIdentify what could possibly go wrong\nThere\u2019s this thing called Murphy\u2019s Law. Since a few months ago, whenever we are on a mission, we always create a Murphy\u2019s List \u2013 a list of things that can break. So, we work backwards from there and try to solve for all those cases before we launch a product or initiative. For instance, a bad experience at the restaurant for the user could cause a ripple effect and eventually hamper consumer trust. We addressed it by working relentlessly on training the restaurant staff across restaurants and cities. Despite all the training, we anticipated some teething issues and over-communicated and re-assured our customers at various customer touch points. Consequently, our denial of services (DoS) ratio i.e. instances where the customer has been denied Gold service at a restaurant is less than 0.5% and has been trending downwards over time.\nToo good to be true \ncan\n exist\nMany questioned us in the beginning on our pricing strategy. Many thought the price was set too low. In hindsight, it indeed was. But our objective was quite clear: we were optimising for trials and not for revenue. We were building \u201ca no-brainer\u201d \u2014 a term our product team threw around in the planning stage. In other words, a product that sold itself. Fortunately, all of that happened. Maybe the ultimate litmus test is in fact making the customers wonder out loud \u201cIs this for real?\u201d when they hear about your product. Eventually, the product pricing is 2.5x of the launch pricing, and the conversion rates on the plan page are still holding up (maybe there\u2019s still a tonne of room to increase pricing).\nYour customers are your best marketing bet\nWord of mouth and referrals worked wonders for us. 40% of our total sales were referral driven. Lucrative incentives on either side i.e. referrer and referee helped to drive sales for Zomato Gold. This was further amplified by the smooth experience that the users had when they went out to a Gold restaurant.\nProactively listen to your customers and partners (on either side of the marketplace)\nIn any business, listening to your stakeholders is probably the most important thing. We kept reaching out to customers as well as restaurant partners to find their NPS score.We also asked them the primary reason driving the score. And that made us learn a host of things. Insightful things.\u00a0\nAccording to our restaurant partners, \nincrease in new customers and improvement in customer loyalty was the biggest driver for satisfaction with Zomato Gold. Additionally, we found that there is a 3x increase in Zomato traffic on Gold vis-a-vis non-Gold restaurants. The increase in inbound requests from restaurant partners \n(more than 200 per month as we speak)\n further reinstates the excitement for Zomato Gold in the restaurant owner community.\nWhich brings us to our two other important learnings \u2013\nKeep building\nBased on this feedback from restaurant owner community, and the inbounds we have been getting, we added some great places to Zomato Gold after the launch \u2013 the number of partners on Gold now is 2300 compared to around 1100 at the time of launch. The average rating of the places we added after launch is more than the selection we had online at the time of launch. This made Zomato Gold customers even happier, and we are now trending upwards with our customer NPS of 84%. \\m/\nChurn and let churn\nSome of our restaurant partners weren\u2019t providing the best experience to Gold customers, because of lack of intent or professionalism. We measure DoS on an outlet by outlet basis and voluntarily churn rogue restaurant partners on Zomato Gold. Until now, we have proactively churned 70% of the partners that have churned so far. The other 30% churned from the program, because of two reasons \u2013 1) there have been a lot of sealing by the local government for various reasons, 2) some restaurant owners make decisions based on exceptions rather than looking at data (for example, if there was one loss making table due to Gold in a week, they would churn). We didn\u2019t make much effort to save such restaurants from the program \u2013 because we knew that this would lead to a poor user experience eventually. These were tough calls, and were taken with a lot of determination \u2013 but we knew that we were doing the right thing.\nAnd according to our users, \nZomato Gold offers \u201cgreat value\u201d and that has continued to be remain the key proposition driver. Gold is making dining out a lot more affordable than it used to be. Additionally, gold is helping users explore new restaurants \u2013 \n83% of our users discovered and visited a Gold partner restaurant for the first time, after becoming a member\n. Zomato is a search and discovery platform at the core \u2013 and we are so happy that Gold is adding to the spirit of Zomato in a big way. Check out what some of our customers had to say \u2013\nIn conclusion, we can note that Zomato Gold is just getting started. Our team envisions great possibilities in the near horizon for all the parties involved. Exciting times ahead \u2014 indeed.\nAs always, kindly share your feedback/suggestions by dropping us a mail at \ngold@zomato.com"

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "A little more than 10 years ago, on the 26th of January 2008 (also my birthday), I thought it was a perfect day to turn live a website that I was working on for about 2 months. Back then, it was called foodlet.in; in a few days that website got renamed to foodiebay.com (domain names should always be .com \u2013 just because). (and for everyone who doesn\u2019t know this \u2013 foodiebay.com eventually became zomato.com)\nBack then, I worked on the website on the weekends along with my wife, and her younger sister. We used to drive around the city, collect menus from restaurants, scan them and put them online. All three of us did this outside of our regular jobs. We would get about 25 visitors everyday, and also received occasional feedback from some of these users that foodiebay was great, and scanned menus (to order food easily) were one of the best things that ever happened to them.\nAt this point in time, I was at Bain & Company; and I knew Pankaj because we used to play foosball during lunch time and were very competitive with each other. He was a lot better than me \u2013 and to my frustration, used to invariably beat me hands down. We only got a chance to work with each other in July 2008.\nWhile working on a project, one day during lunch, I had the Google Analytics page for foodiebay open on my laptop. Pankaj looked at it and curiously asked me what that was. I told him that these are the traffic stats for foodiebay, and there are currently 3 people looking at foodiebay. Mockingly, he said \u201cthat\u2019s too little; also, most of these folks must be from Bain\u201d. I frowned. He said \u2013 \u201clet me help\u201d. And he changed his gtalk (remember gtalk?) status to \u201cgo check out foodiebay.com\u201d \u2013 and within minutes there were 10 people on the website. And the daily traffic tripled. Pankaj got a huge kick out of it \u2013 and so I asked if he wants to build this with me, together (with no plan or intention of what this could eventually become). He said \u201cyes, this is fun, let\u2019s do this\u201d. That day was 10th July, 2008 \u2013 the day we officially celebrate the birthday of Zomato.\nFor the last 10 years, Pankaj has not only been my co-founder, he has been the keeper of my conscience, my friend in good times, my support system during upheavals; he has been a brother and family to me. In the truest sense we have both grown up at Zomato \u2013 started families, grew and scaled the business beyond what we set out to accomplish, had each other\u2019s back through the downfalls, while sharing innumerable milestones and cherished memories.\nPankaj has given both me and Zomato ten of the best years of his life (he was 22 when he started), and would now like to take time to think about what he wants to build next. Today \u2013 the time has come for me to help him realise his own dreams and aspirations, just like he once enabled me to accomplish mine. As of 31st March, Pankaj will be moving on from an active role at Zomato to focus on the next chapter in his personal journey. He will continue to be an important part of Zomato in the future as well, and keep serving on our Board of Directors.\nA few hours ago, Pankaj sent this farewell email to everyone at Zomato \u2013\nI feel that Zomato builds incredibly resilient people and when they go, they should do something new on their own. Very few organisations build an individual\u2019s character and resilience the way we do (maybe it\u2019s a good thing that we are a hard place to work at). Over the next 20 years, I will be very proud if there are a 1000 Zoman babies (1000 startups by ex-zomans). I think we must already be 5-10% there. And I am very eagerly looking forward to see what Pankaj will build next.\nSo while I still do not have the words to express my gratitude to Pankaj for the faith he put in me, and the strength and support he brought to the table over the last decade, as well as the sheer brilliance of the journey we shared; all I can say is that I am wholeheartedly thankful to him for everything, and that everyone at Zomato will truly miss him, and cheer for him from the sidelines.\nGoing forward, we will celebrate July 10th as Pankaj Day at Zomato, and if his schedule permits, will have him host a townhall for all of Zomato \u2013 every year.\nThank you, PC, for the most phenomenal journey. Farewell and godspeed!"

        "content": "We belong to, and are very passionate about the restaurant industry; and firmly believe that restaurants should be safe social places where people go to enjoy each other\u2019s company, eat great food and build communities. All adding to a happy and fulfilling life. People should not be worried about their safety (existential or otherwise) while visiting restaurants. Restaurants should be everybody\u2019s happy places.\nWe are deeply saddened by the enormous loss of lives due to the fire incident at Kamla Mills (Mumbai) late December last year, and other similar incidents. And we know that everybody in the restaurant industry ecosystem shares the sense of loss. This was also a deeply introspective moment for us here at Zomato.\nThis incident made us take a step back and think that at some point of time in the past, we could have done something to reduce the probability of such an incident; and that realization pains us immensely. Looking forward, we are committing to using the power of Zomato as a discovery platform to bring in a systemic change in the entire industry so that people eat and live better.\nWe understand the problem is complex with multiple parties involved, but we are starting with doing our part right away \u2013 effective immediately, we are prioritizing safety related initiatives within Zomato. You may have heard about our \nfood safety initiative\n before and that\u2019s coming along nicely.\nWe are now also working with restaurants to put up fire safety license scans on Zomato.\nCurrently, only a handful of restaurants have this information available on Zomato. We are actively reaching out to more businesses to furnish their fire safety licenses. \nRestaurant owners, if you want to get your fire safety license displayed on Zomato, please email it to firesafety@zomato.com\n; for restaurants which fail to furnish their fire safety certificates, we are going to put a \u201cDenied\u201d symbol on their pages, so that our users know that that restaurant failed to share their fire safety certificate with us.\nNow, putting up fire safety license scans on Zomato is just a small start \u2013 most restaurants in India \u2018technically\u2019 need a fire license to start operating, and I am sure we will be able to get and display fire licenses for most places. The problem is deeper and systemic in nature (e.g. fake licenses) with so many other involved parties, and the answers are going to be complex. We don\u2019t have all the answers right now. But the important thing is that we are committed to finding systemic solutions to these issues so that we lower the probability of any type of safety incidents in restaurants.\nEventually, our goal is to make comprehensive safety information easily accessible on the platform, so our user community can make informed choices. We believe this will help raise safety standards across the industry and make attention to safety a differentiator for our restaurant partners."

        "author": "Tanvi Duggal",
        "content": "At Zomato, our motto is to ensure our users never have a bad meal. It\u2019s been more than 10 years of improving upon what we do every day and making sure that our users are able to make informed choices about eating great food. Yet, at the heart of it, we still see ourselves as the place where our users go to share their dining stories (reviews!). That\u2019s why we love to hear from our foodies \u2013 be it the good, the bad or the ugly \u2013 and all this feedback is also very essential for our restaurant partners to improve upon what they do on a daily basis.\nLast year, we ran a series of initiatives to ensure Zomato remains a credible and a bias-free platform for our users and restaurant partners. One such initiative was to \nallow restaurant partners to report reviews\n (Project Fairplay) that were written by users to \nblackmail\n restaurants in lieu of discounts or free meals. With this feature, we were able to identify a number of users who repeatedly engaged in this practice, \u00a0subsequently leading to the removal of their accounts from Zomato.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nThe next initiative in this project will help us tackle a major problem that plagues most platforms \u2013 fake and biased reviews. There is no doubt that restaurants need to invest in marketing and good PR to spread the word about their business. But resorting to unethical methods in order to gain fake reviews is where one needs to draw a line. Such restaurants may temporarily see a spike in their rating but sooner or later, these reviews are caught and deleted from Zomato by our Neutrality Team, resulting in a dramatic decrease in that restaurant\u2019s rating.\nSimply put, such malpractices are not worth the restaurants\u2019 time.\nAs any platform that thrives on user-generated content, Zomato also faces bad actors (both users and restaurants) who write reviews that are not genuine. To counter such reviews, we have strengthened our anti-bias and anti-spam algorithms significantly to weed out fake reviews from Zomato. These algorithms will be run on all reviews received on the platform retrospectively, as well.\nImpact of this change\nMost restaurants \nwill not\n see any impact on their rating. However, some will, especially if they\u2019ve been a recipient of fake or solicited reviews. Because of the relative (graded) nature of our ratings, some restaurants may also see their rating go up (or down) without any change in their user content. That\u2019s why, we always recommend getting reviews organically, as the rating derived from such reviews is steadfast and holds true, as well as presents a picture of consistency and quality to (potential) future customers.\nWith this change, we hope that only the best content percolates to our users, thereby maintaining the trust that our users have on Zomato. As we\u2019ve iterated over the years, we\u2019ve been working on ways to \u00a0keep the bias out\u2014an uphill battle worth fighting by all means\u2014and something we will continue to do forever."

We were optimistically expecting to sell 10,000 memberships over a week\u2019s time \u2013 but sold multiple times more than that, in less than 2 days.\nThere are only a little over 1200 Zomato Gold partners as of now; and they are as excited as us about the initial success of Zomato Gold. Given the high number of subscriptions at launch, \nwe had to stop accepting any new members\n for the fear that Zomato Gold subscribers might not be able to get a table at any of our 1200 restaurant/bar partners. These 1200 partners across Delhi NCR, Bengaluru and Mumbai were packed throughout last week, and some of them reported a 40% increase in utilisation during the week. Friday night was packed as well. In fact, our partners have been calling our teams sharing how they\u2019ve been getting a high number of new customers because of Zomato Gold \u2013 our restaurant partners could not be happier.\nWe reached out to some of our restaurant partners to get their initial feedback on Zomato Gold. Here\u2019s what they have to say \u2013\nWe piloted Zomato Gold in Dubai and Lisbon 9 months ago, and we have learnt a whole lot on how to launch, manage and grow Zomato Gold. Our India launch is a testament to the great work put in by our team, and we look forward to launching Zomato Gold in more cities in India very soon.\nWe also ran a survey with some Zomato Gold subscribers, and asked them if subscribing to Zomato Gold will make them eat out more often than earlier. An astoundingly large percentage (87%) of the responders said \u201cdefinitely yes\u201d. We also asked them if a Zomato Gold subscription will actively restrict their going out behaviour towards Zomato Gold partners. An even larger number of respondents (94%) said yes. This is a huge win for our users, as well as our merchant partner base.\nHere\u2019s what some of our early adopters have to say about the Zomato Gold experience \u2013\nWe will open up the subscription for a brief window of time next week, at a much higher price than the introductory price; while we continue working to ensure that Zomato Gold subscribers have great experiences when they use their membership.\nA lot of restaurant and bar owners have also reached out to us since the launch of Zomato Gold, to enrol in the program. We are not accepting each and every request for enrolment, because we want to make sure that our users get the best choices under the program. However, as we add more members, we will proportionally increase the number of Zomato Gold restaurant partners out there.\nThanks everyone for the excitement around Zomato Gold. We hope we are able to create a one-of-a-kind blockbuster loyalty program for restaurants, as well as users alike.\n\ud83d\udd36"

        "content": "Last month, we hosted the 4th edition of the Huddle, by Zomato \u2013 this meetup was focused on Machine Learning (ML). The topic was chosen keeping in mind the intense discourse this theme beckons, as well as our own aggressive focus on ML for the past 18 months.\nThe gathering consisted of engineers, data scientists and CTOs from several leading technology and product companies such as \u2013 Mobikwik, Times Internet, Policy Bazaar, Snapdeal, Grofers, Shuttl, and BabyChakra among others. The sessions by the teams at Hike Messenger, Delhivery and Zomato ensured that the evening was an insightful one, ripe with engaging discussions during the Q&A and open knowledge sharing post the talks.\nAs always, we are sharing below some of the key learnings from the sessions, hope this is relevant for other ML enthusiasts \u2013\nThe 3 ingredients of personalization\nDebdoot Mukherjee \u2013 Director, Data Science at Hike opened the evening\u2019s session with a talk on product personalization. He explained the role and interaction of three key ingredients \u2014 Content, Context and User \u2014 to get personalization right.\nDebdoot highlighted that a \u2018cold start problem\u2019 can be solved by starting with popularity and gradually introducing relevancy as we learn more and more about the user. He further emphasized on the importance of \u2018explain-ability\u2019 of recommendations i.e. calling out why we are recommending what we are recommending to a user; which can be taken a step further by introducing manual feedback. Below is an example of a popular e-commerce portal, following the \u2018explain-ability\u2019 mantra.\nLogistics optimization and reducing mis-routes\nDr. Kabir Rustogi and Rahul Kumar Singla from the Data Science team at Delhivery led the second session on logistics \u2013 which they highlighted was a billion dollar challenge for the Indian economy today!\nSolving the image aesthetics problem\nML team from Zomato spoke about building an \nensemble model using deep and feature-based learning\n to assess image aesthetics of photos uploaded by users on Zomato. Showcasing only high-quality, rich content from the millions of pictorial UGC added every month is critical, not only for user experience, but also for ensuring high click-through rates on the platform.\nThey explained how the aesthetics problem was initially set up as a classification problem with historical manual labelling of images serving as training data. However, the classic AlexNet structure which works very well for classification of photos into food shots vs. ambience shots, didn\u2019t quite produce high quality results for aesthetics (low vs. high quality images) due to aspect ratio constraints.\nIntroduction of \nspatial pyramid pooling\n in the network helped them circumvent the constraint, and finally the ensemble of fisher vector-based feature model with deep learning resulted in a 90% + accuracy for image aesthetics classification.\nOverall, the Huddle was highly engaging with each session touching upon different types of issues being solved across domains, using varied aspects of machine learning. What was interesting to note was how age-old problems are now being solved more efficiently and smartly by leveraging the exponentially increasing power of computation and storage.\nFun times ahead indeed!\nWe\u2019ll be back with our next Huddle within a few months. Watch this space for more! For any information on Huddle, do reach out to us at \nhuddle@zomato.com\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNaresh Mehta is leading the data science and advanced analytics vertical at Zomato with key focus on recommendation engines, search algorithms and ensuring harmony between statisticians/analysts and ML engineers in data science team."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/hygiene-ratings/",
        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "Three months ago, we ran a survey amongst our users and found that 86% of them would prefer dining at, or ordering in from restaurants that have transparent food hygiene standards. Moreover, 93% users gave more weightage to wanting to eat at/ order in from a hygienic place \u2013 that is, given a choice, they would rather go to a place that they know is clean and hygienic, over a place which serves food that tastes just great.\nThe interesting thing is that while most of our users clearly and strongly care about food hygiene at restaurants, they don\u2019t know, or have a trusted source that tells them \u2013 whether a particular restaurant is hygienic and follows prescribed food hygiene standards for the well being of their customers.\nTo address this need-gap, and to better educate our users, we are excited to introduce Food Hygiene Ratings for restaurants listed on Zomato.\nZomato will only act as an organiser of these Food Hygiene Ratings for the industry. We do not believe that we are the experts in food hygiene, therefore, we will work with accredited third party auditors \u2013 who are experts in their field and will conduct surprise physical food hygiene audits at participating restaurants. \nThese audits will check whether they meet various aspects of the food hygiene \u2013 e.g. how is the food handled, does the restaurant have separate cooking spaces for vegetarian and non-vegetarian items, the basic cleanliness level of the restaurant, and how the business manages what it does; i.e. to make sure food is prepared and served in a clean environment. \nHere\u2019s a small section of our food hygiene audit checklist \u2013\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFood Hygiene standards found at the time of an audit will be rated on a scale of 1 to 5 \u2013 where 1 would denote an urgent need for improvement, and 5 would denote high standards of food hygiene at the premises. It\u2019s rather simple \u2013 higher ratings mean better food hygiene standards.\nTo begin with, we are launching this initiative in the UAE and Australia. Our current goal is that in our learning phase upto March 2018, we will help provide food hygiene ratings for about 1,000 restaurants in the UAE and 3,000 in Australia. We have also started thinking along these lines for India, and are working with stakeholders from the restaurant industry as well as regulatory bodies to ensure that we can all use each other\u2019s strengths to improve the overall perception and reality of the restaurant industry. \nThis is how the food hygiene ratings will be integrated into the Zomato app.\nAs the Food Hygiene Ratings initiative gains traction over the next few months, you will see more and more restaurants with these rating on the Zomato platform. And if your favourite restaurant doesn\u2019t have a food hygiene rating on Zomato in a few months, it should give you something to think about.\nIf you have any ideas about what we need to watch out for as we jump into doing this, or any suggestions on how to improve this initiative, please let us know at \nhygiene@zomato.com"

        "author": "Surobhi Das",
        "content": "We have been working on a bunch of concurrent initiatives for our restaurant partners \u2013 \nZomato Skillet\n, \nBeta Period\n, and \n#MissionGiveBack\n to solve for some of the challenges faced by the industry. \nWe take tremendous pride in the fact that restaurant owners consider Zomato a trusted partner in their entrepreneurial journey, while our users rely on us as a neutral, bias-free platform. However, as we grew stronger as a platform, and became an important part of our users and restaurant owners lives, some bad actors started abusing the platform to their benefit. This led to an unhealthy cycle of two things \u2013 very simply put, we can call them \nblackmail\n and \nbribery\n.\nWhat\u2019s blackmail?\nWhen users try to solicit perks like free meals, discounts, or cash in exchange for positive reviews or with the veiled threat of a poor review if the restaurateur refuses \u2013 that is blackmail. \nWhat\u2019s bribery?\nWhen restaurant owners/managers proactively reach out to PR agencies or directly to users with large followings on Zomato, and offer them freebies or money in exchange of positive reviews or rating \u00a0\u2013 that is bribery. \nThese are nascent but growing problems at Zomato, and while our machines and neutrality team do a stupendous job at identifying and mitigating the menace, we decided to create a larger systemic fix for the issue.\nToday, we have launched a feature aiming towards solving \nblackmail\n as a problem on Zomato. Starting now \u2013 restaurateurs can directly flag any review that has been written with malicious intent. When that happens, the review will not get immediately moderated, but we will use that data to identify bad users on Zomato over the long term and eventually freeze their profiles and delete their past reviews.\nHow it works\nRestaurant owners can use Zomato for Business app (download it from\n \niOS App Store\n or\n \nGoogle Play Store\n) and use the \u201cReport Abuse\u201d button to directly flag a review that was written with malicious intent. There\u2019s no guarantee that the review will be taken down \u2013 but this will help us make the system cleaner and get rid of bad actors over the long term. Our team will also review each reported case along with shared evidence \u2013 and if we believe in the evidence, we will moderate the review.\nWe are hoping that with this feature on our business app, we will be able to identify users with malicious intent very easily. \nHaving said that, \nbefore the end of the year, you will see significant steps being taken towards solving bribery as well \n(that will be Part 2 of this post). An important part of solving bribery is letting users report instances where restaurants (or the agencies they hire) have offered something for free to soliciting a \npositive\n review. In such cases, we will put up a \u201cshame banner\u201d on zomato \u2013 which tells our entire user base that this restaurant is not an ethical business to deal with, and you should probably not be eating at this place. Because if someone doesn\u2019t hold themselves to the highest ethical standards on one count, you can\u2019t trust that business to hold themselves to the highest standards on a number of other counts \u2013 including serving hygienic food, for example."

That was when we introduced zero commission food orders for our restaurant partners in India.\nLast month, in September, we hit a bloody-cool little milestone of 1 million reservations through our table reservations service. And that\u2019s in just about one year of entering this space \u2013 probably making us the largest player in this space across India, UAE, Philippines, and (maybe) Australia.\nToday, as part of the #MissionGiveBack, we are extending a similar benefit to all our restaurant partners across the world who accept table reservations through Zomato. Retrospectively from June 1, 2017 onward, our restaurant partners will not need to pay a \u201cper cover\u201d fee or even a platform fee to accept seamless digital table reservations from Zomato. Yes, the service will be completely free.\nEvery month, millions of users explore and visit restaurants using Zomato. With this change in fee structure, we are expecting that more restaurants start accepting online reservations from Zomato, and also not switch off their reservation slots during peak hours on weekends. Together, with our restaurant partners, we want to ensure that we put user experience at the center of everything that we do.\nIn the last few weeks, we\u2019ve also upgraded our platform to make the online reservation process faster, simpler and more convenient for both diners and restaurants. And there\u2019s a lot more coming in the next few weeks.\nThe table reservations service is enabled for a tad more than 10,000 restaurants in 4 countries across the world. We look forward to continue to deeply integrate with more restaurants across the countries of our presence, and bring great experiences to diners. Great user experiences will help the industry grow, and Zomato definitely grows along with the industry.\nIf you are a restaurant owner who receives online reservations through the Zomato platform (or qualify to avail this service), look out for an email (in the next 72 hours) to learn more about this change and what it means for you. In the meanwhile, if you have any feedback for us, please write to me at\u00a0\nd@zomato.com,\n\u00a0or Gaurav Tandon (our head of table reservations business) at \ngt@zomato.com\n\u00a0\u2013 we would love to hear from you."

In the long term, we think that only hobbyists will cook at home \u2013 cooking should be something that people should want to do because it\u2019s a joyous activity for themselves or with their loved ones, instead of it being a chore.\nOf course, this is a distant dream (at least in India), but we are working on a bunch of exciting tech-led initiatives to build better accessibility to great and hygienic food for our users. In tandem we are also exploring alliances with existing players, big and small, to help surface a larger variety of healthy meal options to our users. In that spirit, we just made an investment into a startup called Tinmen \u2013 an efficient and modest little company which provides easy access to home cooked meals at affordable prices, for thousands of people in Hyderabad.\nThe home chefs on Tinmen use fresh ingredients and offer a variety of choices while also allowing users to choose what they would eat for lunch as well as dinner. Tinmen is already delivering over 30,000 orders a month, and we see this number steadily multiplying over the next 6 to 9 months.\nUsers love Tinmen \u2013 and we love them too. Zomato and Tinmen will work together (initially in Hyderabad, and then the rest of the country) to provide access to better food for more people. Through Tinmen\u2019s unique operating model, they also generate a steady stream of revenue for their home-chefs \u2013 thereby creating earning opportunities for people who love to cook great food out of the comfort of their homes.\nIf you are in Hyderabad, please download the Tinmen app for Android \nhere\n and iOS \nhere\n.

        "content": "I\u2019m very excited to share, that beginning today, you will see our team in their red Zomato t-shirts delivering food to you. We\u2019ve been adding to our Runnr team steadily over the past week; it is already 1500 strong, and growing by the day. Just to ensure that you get your food with a smile, and on time!\nYes, that\u2019s right, we just signed our long-rumoured acquisition of Runnr.\nEmotionally, the deal has been in place for a couple of months now, and both the teams have been working closely with each other quite some time now. So much so, Mohit Kumar, the Founder & CEO of Runnr, has been living in Delhi (moving from Bangalore) for about two months already.\nIn May, for about a month after the first time Mohit and I spoke about potentially joining forces, he worked with the Zomato team closely to gauge whether the Runnr team would get along with ours. Zomato is an amalgam of many companies (online ordering, point of sales, infrastructure services, advertising, etc.) sharing a unified mission. The independent velocities and strengths of the different teams at Zomato gave the team at Runnr the required comfort that they would have all the levers they needed to build the business the way they always wanted to \u2013 while being aligned with a much larger mission.\nMohit also realised that Zomato\u2019s worldview included building an all-encompassing product and services platform for restaurants, and he saw exactly how Runnr could become the essential logistics company within (and beyond) Zomato. It made sense for him to go all in. For us at Zomato, we saw that we were going to be working with a team of extremely driven individuals who had figured out how to solve for a vital piece of our puzzle\u2014the one that affects our user delight: logistics. With the combination of Zomato and Runnr, we have everything in the stack of building a delightful food delivery service in India and UAE \u2013 end to end \u2013 listings, discovery, reviews, ordering, and now, logistics.\nFor the record, we have always maintained that the most cost-efficient delivery fleet is the restaurant\u2019s own, where they can utilise the same staff during off-peak hours for back-of-house and marketing activities. That belief is still intact. Keeping that in mind, Runnr will continue to function as an independent logistics company (owned by Zomato) offering the full stack of logistical services to players other than Zomato as well \u2013 e.g. pharma, grocery, e-commerce, etc. This will ensure that the delivery fleet capacity that we build operates on a positive unit economics level while serving the mega-peaks in the food delivery business.\nRunnr is already efficiently fulfilling 300k orders a month \u2013 which is just a tad less than 10% of our food ordering volumes. Mohit will remain the Founder and CEO of Runnr and will continue developing his vision along with the rest of the founding team \u2013 Arpit, Mukunda, Gnanesh, Vatsal, and Aravind.\nThe entire team at Zomato is very eager to work with Mohit and the team, and delight our users more than we have ever been able to before. We are also excited to work towards generating meaningful employment at scale using our logistics platform. At Zomato and Runnr, the delivery boy is going to get the status of \u201cmost important employee\u201d and is going to be treated like one.\nOn my part, whenever I see a delivery boy on the road, I slow down (or stop) to respect the right of way. After all, every meal matters."

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "A month or so ago, I was at a newly opened restaurant in Gurgaon and I had a chance to speak to the entrepreneur behind it. I almost never miss an opportunity to speak to restaurant owners to get their feedback on whether Zomato is helpful to their business, and to understand if we are enabling them to make the right decisions about their business.\nWhile most of our discussion centred around product improvements, and where the restaurant industry is heading, he said something that struck a chord with me. He said, \u201c\nWhile Zomato has helped us get a lot of new customers, it wasn\u2019t always easy. When I had just started a few months ago, I had to almost shut down because of Zomato, until I pulled up my socks and worked my a** off to survive, and succeed\n.\u201d\nWhen I asked him to elaborate, he said that when he opened his first restaurant a few months ago, he was new to everything. So new that he had to juggle 600 things at the same time. 75% of his days were spent learning and reacting to things that he didn\u2019t know were going to break during the day. He was the chef, the ops guy, table service guy, the delivery boy, all rolled into one \u2013 a full stack employee. And with all the teething issues, Zomato made his life very hard. He said that the online presence on Zomato is relentless and was stressful for him as a new restaurant owner. Why? Because during his first week of operations (he was of course listed on Zomato), he got 16 reviews which weren\u2019t particularly kind to him. All because of the teething issues that he was facing. He fully believed that his restaurant wasn\u2019t worth just the 2.9 rating that it got during the first two weeks. Proof? The restaurant is now rated a healthy 4.2 on Zomato, and has more than 500 reviews.\nHe didn\u2019t get an opportunity to fully stabilise his operations early on before his restaurant\u2019s rating started to drop. While he emphasised that the feedback was necessary for him to grow, he also argued that the penalty from a bad review could have been a death sentence, especially for a new place. We heard this sentiment echoed by other partners too. Along with trying to resolve the teething issues, this becomes a huge problem and an existential worry for entrepreneurs, as a low rating may prevent new customers from visiting the restaurant.\nSince one of our core missions at Zomato has been to help restaurants achieve long term success and sustainability, we decided to do something about it.\nWhat are we doing?\nHospitality is the most fleeting of industries. A large number of restaurants cease operations within the first few months of opening. It\u2019s extremely disappointing for us to see this, as a lot of people work very hard to get things off the ground, and then don\u2019t get to enjoy the fruits of their labour for very long.\nAlong with \nSkillet\n, which will allow us to engage more openly and directly with restaurant owners, we have been making a few changes to our product, especially for new restaurants owners and start-ups.\n\u00a0\nTo make sure they navigate these early days better and more productively, new restaurants will get a \u201cbeta period\u201d on Zomato \u2013 their overall rating will only start showing after 60 days, regardless of the reviews and ratings they receive in that time. Further, the initial few reviews gathered during that 60 day period will not count towards overall rating forever \u2013 although these reviews will remain visible on their Zomato pages.\nDuring this phase, these restaurants will get a \u2018New\u2019 tag on Zomato to help users identify them (this will be in place of the rating tag shown against a restaurant name on Zomato). This way, restaurants will get direct, valuable feedback from their customers to fix any problems that may crop up during the very early days, without worrying about the existential concern of a low restaurant rating.\nThis beta period will be given to all restaurants that are new on the platform, with an important exception being chain restaurants with more than 2 outlets. Chains with 2 or more outlets are usually not expected to have teething issues based on our conversations with various industry experts. The\u00a0\u2018New\u2019 label will still appear on every new restaurant page, whether it\u2019s a part of a chain or not.\nWhy are we doing this?\nSimply put, we understand teething issues, and we need to account for that. By introducing this \u201cbeta period\u201d, we believe new restaurants will have a better opportunity to stabilise, plug any gaps that may appear in the early days, and build great experiences for diners in the long term.\nWe hope that this effort will help more restaurants get that initial foothold they need, to learn and grow to their potential. And we\u2019ll be there, every step of the way, learning and growing with them."

It means a lot to us, and we obviously can\u2019t control our excitement.\nLao Tzu once said, \u201cA journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step\u201d, and just like that, we took our first step towards building our online ordering business in June 2015. Today, we have hit 3 million orders for the last 31-day period. It took us 13 months to reach the first million orders a month; the second million took us 8 months, and the third million took us a little over 4 months.\nHere are some important numbers for the business \u2013\nBy platform, Android contributes ~51%, iPhone ~38% and Web ~11%\nThe share of restaurant delivered orders is ~93%\nVery high customer retention \u2013 ~65% of newly signed up users for our food ordering business order again from Zomato in the next 12 months\nCAC is still negligible \u2013 we are still not spending money to acquire users and our listings business is still feeding the baby\nFor everyone who has given Zomato Order a shot \u2013 we thank you for giving us an opportunity to serve you. It is both humbling and exhilarating for us to get a shot at building the first large global consumer internet brand, based out of India. We truly value your patronage and hope that we continue to have your loyalty and support while doing that.\nNeedless to say, we\u2019re continuously trying to get better. We have a host of new features coming up in our app \u2013 and we\u2019re excited for you to try them out.\nFor example, one of the smaller new features is for one of those bad days when you\u2019re coughing and sneezing \u2013 you will soon be able to tell us that the meal you just ordered is for someone who\u2019s a bit under the weather. And we will do everything in our power to expedite your delivery, just so that you can get your chicken clear soup ASAP.\nAlso, an instruction for the restaurant to not send you that plastic cutlery (we all have plenty of it lying around at home, and probably don\u2019t need any more of it for a year).\nParting notes \u2013 if you have any feedback for us, please write to me at mukund@zomato.com, or to Deepi at deepinder@zomato.com.

We have also been rapidly improving our products to keep up with constantly evolving consumer needs and trends. We currently get over 120 million visitors a month across all platforms \u2013 consuming restaurant information, referencing content generated and shared by other users, placing orders for food delivery, or making reservations at restaurants.\nIn the past we have also been helping the restaurant industry adapt to these changing consumer needs and trends; albeit in a fragmented and unorganized manner \u2013 through customer reviews, restaurant summits, and advanced analytics, mostly when asked for by restaurant partners.\nWhile we have spent the last decade with a very heavy focus on helping our users discover great food, one of our core missions for the next decade is to ensure the long-term success and sustainable growth of restaurants.\nThis will happen by helping restaurants focus relentlessly on the right product offerings to the right consumer segments, as well as improvements in quality of food, and quality of service. These core elements will boost the ease of eating out/ordering in, and provide exponential growth to the already flourishing restaurant industry.\nZomato Skillet\n \nis one of the many initiatives we will be taking in this direction.\nWhat is Skillet?\nSkillet is an educational forum for restaurateurs, wherein we will host a series of workshops to help them identify market opportunities, discuss challenges with peers, learn from experiences of masterchefs, and address pain points in the business. Since the restaurant community is highly diverse, and each restaurant\u2019s approach differs greatly \u2013 we are designing a range of workshops for each industry segment.\nThese workshops will be conducted by industry experts and successful restaurateurs. Zomato will continue to contribute our learnings from consumer behaviour, and our global exposure, back to the industry.\nSkillet will be a great opportunity for us to come together, and meaningfully grow the ecosystem. We will start out by hosting the workshops across key cities in India, and then eventually take this initiative to our other countries of our presence.\nWhom is it for?\nThese workshops will cater to restaurant owners, promoters, CXOs and F&B managers. The goal of these workshops is to provide actionable insights on various aspects of the restaurant business.\nSkillet \u2013 Volume I\nWe\u2019ll be kickstarting Skillet in New Delhi in August this year, and the theme for our first workshop is \u2018Branching out \u2013 expansion and scaling up\u2019. This will be relevant for restaurateurs who are looking to open their 2nd or 3rd outlets, and trying to identify the best way to do it \u2013 location, franchising, diversifying into brands, etc.\nWe\u2019re delighted to kick the series off with Priyank Sukhija as the speaker for our very first session. Priyank is one of Delhi\u2019s much-loved and most prolific restaurateurs, running over 25 restaurants including Tamasha, Lord of the Drinks, The Flying Saucer, Warehouse and many other successful brands. A youth icon and one of the most successful restaurateurs in the country, Priyank joins us to share his valuable insights on expansion and scaling up a restaurant business.\nFor more details on the event, please write to \nskillet@zomato.com\n and we\u2019ll get back to you right away."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/5-easy-tips-boost-bar-sales-restaurant/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "The bar at any restaurant is underrated and sometimes undersold, even. More often than not, it acts as a buffer for people to hang around as they wait for their table. It\u2019s also where patrons sit for drinks when they are alone or with one other person. Many times they hang out at the bar because of the bartender. It also acts like a centrepiece of the restaurant, drawing attention, and is part of what defines your restaurant.\nAnother function of the bar is to make drinks for diners in the dining area. Your bartender\u2019s flare won\u2019t work here. But simply getting the drinks right will. Every bar menu has the usual suspects. How you can make it work to your advantage lies with you and your staff. Servers and managers do double as salespeople to push dishes and drinks. But you can do more and you can do better than that.\nA few things to keep in mind to push your bar sales will help reflect in overall performance of your restaurant.\nRecommend the right drink\nUsually, we encounter servers and managers pushing down more expensive dishes and drinks down customers\u2019 throats (pun intended). Well, they have to learn to recommend and not sell. Sale will follow a recommendation. But suggesting random expensive drinks will only make the customer believe that the person doesn\u2019t know the bar well enough. A training session with the bartender and chef could be of much help as opposed to just telling them to \u201cpush drinks\u201d in the name of sales.\nSpecial drinks\nRestaurants now have special menus and are trying out various things to make their \nmenu stand out\n. After all, why leave the bar behind? In other words, don\u2019t limit your special menu to only food. Kindly include drinks as well. Special cocktails for special occasions will have any cocktail-loving patron ordering them. When you\u2019re using seasonal produce in your food, don\u2019t forget to talk to your bartender and see if it can be fitted in a cocktail. For example, it\u2019s still mango season and you can make great cocktails with this fruit. The same will be true for strawberries or any other ephemeral fruit. These kind of special drinks will help the staff push them even more.\nSpread the word\nOne great way of promoting your drinks is through social media. Posting high-quality images of your best cocktails can be a sure shot way of luring customers in. People go into bars specifically for drinks more often than you\u2019d think. Then there are those who need to be nudged to order a drink. Sometimes, a good picture is a good enough lure. If you don\u2019t have the budget to hire a photographer, simply click pictures using a phone with a good camera. Good light and angles are your friends. Haven\u2019t you heard of the photographer who used an iPhone to shoot an entire wedding?\nLet them contest\nAnother way of pushing drinks is to create curiosity and buzz around it. For instance, a simple contest on social media about the drink will get people to engage with you. Give away the drink on the house and it\u2019ll get others\u2019 attention too. Here, you\u2019d be doing three things at once \u2013 talking about the drink yourself, involving potential customers and creating brand recall. All of which at an almost zero expense marketing trick.\nMake it look awesome\nAfter everything, if your drinks don\u2019t look and taste great, it won\u2019t work. Even classic drinks can look good and taste great. Good barware is where you can start. Build it up with colours and ingredients that add to the drink. Don\u2019t try any tricks that you can\u2019t pull off. A big example of a cocktail disaster was the \nliquid nitrogen in a cocktail that tore a customer\u2019s stomach\n. People want value for money and not cheap gimmicks.\n\u2014\nAll in all, don\u2019t lose focus from your bar. It plays a key role in your business. Markup on drinks will always be high and pushing them can help those profit margins. On that note, cheers!"

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/5-tips-sail-restaurant-monsoon/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "Monsoon has hit us and almost every big city in the country has been getting rain washed over the past few days. Soaring temperatures have dropped and people are enjoying the weather. It\u2019s all good but a question looms for the restaurateurs: How will monsoons affect the restaurant business? Yes, yes, depending on the intensity of the showers, you might find an empty restaurant or with very little footfall. But all is not lost in these months of rain. People still need to eat even if it\u2019s in the comfort of their home or office. There are a few ways you can still keep business afloat without a packed restaurant day after day.\nKeeping delivery options open\nIf you already do home deliveries, you know how important it is for extra business. You need it now more than the rest of the year. What\u2019s also important is that you keep all windows of delivery opportunity open. Just taking delivery orders via phone calls isn\u2019t enough any more. \nSign up for online orders\n and expand your chances of getting more orders in. If you don\u2019t have enough delivery people, train your restaurant\u2019s staff for emergency deliveries so you don\u2019t fall short. There\u2019s no point hiring more people when you\u2019re trying to make up for lost business through walk-ins.\nMake those offers rain\nWho doesn\u2019t like a good bargain? Particularly when it\u2019s with food, consumers wait for meaty \ndiscounts and offers\n any restaurant has to offer. It\u2019s value for them and business for you. Currently there are many restaurants offering anywhere between 10% to 25% off on online orders via Zomato, of course with a catch like a minimum order. Promotions needn\u2019t only mean discounts. You can also offer a combo deal for lesser price. Have your chef come up with monsoon-related food and combinations you can have for a limited period of time. This will get customers ordering very often.\nKeeping customers busy\nAnother good value addition would be having board games and books at your restaurant or cafe. Ideally, when it begins to rain, there\u2019s nothing much people can do besides wait for it to stop. Why not let them sit around and while away time? Having board games and books will not only keep them occupied but will also get them to order more. It\u2019s a small add-on which will make a difference in overall sales.\nServing special food\nEvery season has something special to offer. Be it seasonal produce or the way we serve our food, the weather has a key role to play. Soups for winters, juices for summers and likewise, hot fried food for monsoons is what sells. Even upscale restaurants have monsoon special menus to take advantage of the season. From loaded French fries fried chicken to something more local, there are several rain special food items to cheer for. Take \nChaayos\n for example, who have kulhad pav bhaji and pakora baskets on their menu at this time. Small joys like these get people\u2019s attention during the damp weather when no one wants to go out.\nKeeping things clean\nMonsoon is also the season of flu, cold, cough and other bugs. That\u2019s one reason why people tend to stay away from any food that isn\u2019t home cooked. It\u2019s a given that restaurants are \nexpected to be hygienic\n and that food is cooked with care. However, we hear of one off cases when even high end restaurants are negligent and pay their price for it. When it\u2019s monsoon, in particular, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to be extra cautious. For instance, bread and other baked goods are vulnerable to spoiling sooner than before during monsoons. So are dairy products. Make sure to be careful with such foods so there\u2019s no chance of them affecting your diners. Because all it takes is one bad experience for them not to return.\n\u2014\u2014-\nUntil the clouds dry up, you have time to rethink varied aspects of your business. From tweaking your menu to renovating the interiors, there\u2019s a lot you can do during these monsoons if you want to start afresh when the rains are done with."

We have since taken several critical measures to strengthen and boost our security checks. Apart from updating existing security practices and improving our overall infrastructure, we\u2019ve also started engaging with the broader security researcher community.\nIntroducing our new bug bounty program\nHackerOne is one of the world\u2019s leading platforms which brings companies and security experts together. We\u2019re excited to announce the launch of our monetary reward-based bug bounty program on HackerOne today.\nThe scope of the program revolves around reporting technical vulnerabilities across our products (web and mobile). The rewards for these bug reports will be based on the severity of potential vulnerability and will be assessed on a case-by-case basis by our infrastructure security team. For example, the rewards may be higher for unique and hard-to-find bugs, and relatively lower for bugs with lower risk of exploitation. The minimum reward for severe bugs like Remote Code Execution or User Personal Information Access is $1000 USD.\nWe would like to thank the team at HackerOne for the guidance and support they have extended to us over the last few weeks.\nWe also encourage security researchers to intimate us of any potential security issues. We will make every effort to quickly resolve all reported issues. To qualify for a bounty, the issue must be reported through HackerOne. More details \nhere\n.\nLearning from our peers and industry experts\nLast year, we launched a technology-focused community initiative \nHuddle\n, with the aim of discussing the challenges the Indian tech ecosystem faces every day. The idea was to create a platform to share our combined learnings, gain feedback and perspective, and exchange ideas.\nThe theme for our next Huddle is \u201cCyber Security\u201d. In addition to sharing our story, we have invited our peers from the Indian tech community, as well as a few industry experts to add their perspective on data security. During the event, scheduled for the 8th of July, we will deep dive into the existing and foreseeable challenges of cyber security. Stay tuned to our \nEngineering Blog\n, where we will be posting insights and learnings from this Huddle.\nIf you\u2019re interested in attending the next Huddle, please register \nhere\n. Since we have limited capacity, we\u2019ll get back to you as soon as possible with a confirmation along with additional details about the event. Just in case we run out of space, and aren\u2019t able to accommodate everyone on the 8th, we\u2019ll make sure that we extend invitations for future Huddles to folks who miss out.\nFor more details, kindly drop a mail to \nhuddle@zomato.com\n \u2013 and we will get back to you promptly."

        "content": "First thing first, what is front of house staff? It\u2019s a few people from your team who will face the customer first hand \u2013 host/hostess, floor manager, bartender and servers. All those reviews about your restaurant is mostly based on the customer\u2019s experience via your front of house staff. Many a time, the absence of someone at the door to welcome a customer can be off-putting. If the seating host or hostess aren\u2019t on top of the game, it may lead to the beginning of an unpleasant experience. All things said and done, a good team at the front of house will ensure a customer has a great dining experience.\nThis team is the face of your restaurant and that\u2019s also why you\u2019ll need to hire a good set of people to do the job. A server who isn\u2019t entirely sure about what\u2019s on the menu or what isn\u2019t available, a bartender doing a shoddy job of mixing a cocktail, a manager who isn\u2019t solution-driven and such similar problems lead to disastrous service time. To add insult to injury, even bad reviews. You don\u2019t want any of that and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have a good front of house team.\nHost/hostess\nAt most establishments, you will find someone at the reception area to help you get a table or take a reservation. They are also responsible for all the reservations done for the day and the upcoming days. The host can set the tone for a customer\u2019s dining experience and you want it to begin on a positive note. What you need in a host is for someone who is friendly, efficient, a multi-tasker and able to handle crowds if needed. While hiring them, put them various hypothetical situations that checks all the skills mentioned. A more realistic approach should get them the job.\nBartender\nBartenders are underrated in our country. Their job is to not just to mix drinks. They can be entertainers and keep a crowd engaged. When the dining room is full and no tables are free, people head to the bar. And how amazing when the bartender makes their evening memorable with the show he can put on. There are many popular mixologists today like Guru Prashant from \nHigh Ultra Lounge (Bangalore)\n and Vijay Singh Rawat from \nThe White Owl (Mumbai)\n who not only mix drinks but have grown in their careers to be successful. What you want in your bartender is the skills of making the perfect classic cocktails, innovative drinks, a little flare, being able to engage with a patron while keeping a key eye on everything that\u2019s going on at the bar.\nServer\nUnless yours is a self-service kind of an establishment, servers are essential to good customer experience. Their contact with the customer is the most and the customer also relies on them with regard to pretty much all there is during their dining time. You want your servers to be courteous, attentive, not pushy, with good communication skills and of course, patience. Despite the footfall, servers have offer great service to customers and that comes with consistency. This can be achieved with training from time to time and giving them the confidence handle customers of any kind to help them do their job better.\nMore than anyone else in the front of house, the host, bartender and the server are the three most important positions you need to fill wisely. Invest in them and you\u2019ll see returns in the form of happy customers."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/5-tips-get-good-restaurant-reviews/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "One of the best parts about running your own restaurant is that you don\u2019t have to wait for a year to know how you\u2019re performing. Your restaurant goes through \u2018appraisals\u2019 almost everyday\u2014thanks to customers. Feedback today is shared everywhere \u2013 in person, online, written. With this kind of openness, you can expect a wide range of comments from your customers. And with them going online, it can go either way. If something\u2019s a hit or a miss, they will make sure others know it. With Zomato and Facebook, restaurant goers everywhere share their experiences for others to read.\nAs we know it, it\u2019s more likely for people to \nshare their bad experiences\n as opposed to their good ones. For a good review you need top scores in most aspects of their dining experience. It\u2019s a no-brainer that you should provide great service and amazing food to your customer. However, sometimes you may miss out on small yet crucial points leading to a bad review from a customer. You know it was an off day, but the customer doesn\u2019t. The customer also wouldn\u2019t care for it. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to keep a few things in place at all times to win that good review on all platforms.\nConsistency\nIt\u2019s a cliche for a reason. Consistency comes with time. It comes with an in depth understanding of what works and what absolutely doesn\u2019t. Your early days are when you invariable end up testing various aspects like certain dishes, service, music and the likes. But if you aren\u2019t tracking what what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t, you\u2019re bound to continue doing things that you may not need to. For example, if red velvet pancakes are a part of your specials menu and over the span of 3 months you\u2019ve sold about 5 plates of them, you can easily replace the dish or simply remove it. If you want to be certain that it doesn\u2019t work, talk to customers. Ask the ones who do order it if they liked it and ask others why they wouldn\u2019t order it. Similarly, if you\u2019re selling more of say, hot wings, lock down that recipe tight and make sure it goes out of your kitchen the same way every single time. Nothing more off putting than going back to a restaurant for a particular dish and being served a slightly altered version of it because you were one ingredient short. Don\u2019t let that happen. It\u2019s easy to lose a customer this way. Consistency is key. Write that down somewhere.\nSpecials\nA commendable special menu in a restaurant is like a pleasant breeze on hot day. People remember it. Using special ingredients or even seasonal produce gets people\u2019s attention. For example, many restaurants across the country are doing mango special menus. Focusing on a fruit that is a favourite among almost everyone means customers coming in just to try something new out. And when they like what they eat, you\u2019re sure to get a good review because it isn\u2019t something they\u2019ll get to have all year. And with a special menu or dish, people want to be the first ones to try it out and tell the world. It\u2019s a great chance for you to have them try out what you have to offer.\nTrends\nIf you\u2019re not up for a specials menu, be sure to have a few stand out signature dishes for people to look forward to. These days freak shakes are in the trend and many cafes and restaurants are incorporating in this in their menu and even making them stand out. There are people who go to such places just to \ntry out the latest trend\n so they can share it on \nsocial media\n. Remember the Starbucks unicorn frappuccino craze? It was all over the internet. Likewise, today there\u2019s the black ice cream. The trend most likely started in New York a couple of months ago and today it has made its way into \nIcekraft\n in Mumbai. There are articles about it, people are taking pictures and sharing reviews on the internet, and since they\u2019re the first movers in India at least, they\u2019ve made quite the mark for themselves.\nEntertainment\nOne way to get people talking is to give them a show. And not just any other gig, but rope in folks who are relatively popular in your city. There\u2019s a lot of talent in almost every city. Music, comedy, art, poetry and so many more genres for you to explore. Entertainment and food at one spot gives customers a wholesome experience. When it goes well, they will share their experiences and spread the word. It also pays off to have something unique at your restaurant to catch attention and for people to talk about it. Like, slam poetry for instance. There are many budding young poets in the country and they need a platform to give voice to their work. Customers are more likely to talk about anything new if they\u2019ve already talked about the food and other aspects at your restaurant.\nService\nThis is a given and has been spoken about multiple times. \nImpeccable service\n earns the staff and your restaurant brownie points. Your wait staff should know how to provide personalized service yet know where to draw the line. Simple things like talking to the diners about what\u2019s special at the restaurant, learning how the diner likes their food \u2013 spice levels, allergies, etc, keeping a tab on the turn around time from when they take the order to when the food gets on the table, the works. Customers almost always include service in their reviews. Even if the kitchen is having an off day, service can save someone\u2019s dining experience.\n\u2014\nThese are just a few things to keep you focused on what you should be doing anyway to keep your restaurant on top of people\u2019s minds. Good reviews will follow when you\u2019re doing everything right while serving a customer."

        "title": "5 Things Not To Do On Your Restaurant&#8217;s Social Media",
        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/restaurants-social-media/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "It\u2019s a no-brainer that social media is a powerful tool that helps any business maintain its image and, by extension, boost sales. Even the restaurant industry has come around to break the shackles of traditional marketing techniques and embrace today\u2019s ways of making their brand appealing to their customers. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Zomato are great tools to connect with your customers and your activities on them will almost immediately reflect the results in your footfall. Having said that, things on social media can easily take a turn for the worse when it\u2019s not done right. You may have a social media agency taking care of all your profiles, but in case you want to be more hands on, this is for you.\nInconsistency in frequency of posting\nFacebook and Instagram users are highly active. And for a restaurant brand, it should be a priority to be noticed. It isn\u2019t about just bringing in new customers anymore. It\u2019s about brand recall and staying on top of your game. Brands like \nDoolally\n, for instance, are doing a great job on Twitter. With their quizzes and genuine interactions with people, they\u2019ve cracked the code of ideal online engagement. What does all this have to do with the frequency posting content? Well, everything. Frequency will determine how often (or not) a user will see your brand online. Too much content without context, like quotes or jokes, is irrelevant to the user. Go back to understanding why they follow you and stick to those reasons \u2013 fun, engagement, food pictures, announcements, and the likes. On the other hand with too little posting of content, whatever it may be, will only reduce the recall of your brand significantly or will simply make users unfollow you. Pace yourself right and you have a winner.\nPosting at the wrong time\nYou know what you have to post, but do you know when not to post? If you don\u2019t want to get into the analytics of it, simply track your posts on your page if it\u2019s Facebook. Instagram will show how your posts performed with impressions, top posts and even when your followers are most active during the day and the week. With such insights, you cannot be going wrong with your timing. The general rule is to post just before mealtime because that\u2019s when most users are online browsing and posting food pictures. Track your posts\u2019 performance and make the right changes if you need to. You don\u2019t want to post a campaign or even a picture of an upcoming dish on your social only to lost out on any traction it may get because enough users weren\u2019t online. It becomes a pointless activity which will only burn resources.\nPosting poor images\nIf you look at some of the pictures on \nZomato\n that restaurants post themselves, you\u2019d be aware of the high-quality of food shots out there. Restaurants take pride in their food and invest in good photos of the dishes they serve. These images can be used to draw eyes of users and get them to walk into your restaurant. Seasonal dishes in particular is best photographed and posted on social media to let people know there\u2019s something new and give them a glimpse of how beautiful the dishes are. Nothing beats a good picture to get the appetite going.\nZero engagement with users\nIs isn\u2019t enough to just post a bunch of things without engaging with users online. Of course, you may choose not to. But engaging the right way means you\u2019re involving the user with your brand. More recall and higher chances of them dropping by. From a quiz to \nresponding to reviews\n, and everything in between is engagement. You are basically trying to convert users to loyal customers when you interact with them. With an online contest, you can\u00a0involve users in an activity and then giving them a prize, let\u2019s say a voucher, you\u2019re literally bringing them into your restaurant. Proactive engagement is clearly one of the most effective ways of marketing your restaurant without spending money.\nNot leveraging it for marketing\nAs an extension of the previous point, social media as a whole is probably the fastest way to reach out to users. Zomato plays a key role in helping narrow down your target audience online \u2013 people who have food on their mind. With ads, \nyou help register your brand\n in their minds. By responding to reviews you build a relationship with them. On your Facebook page, you get to share events and other happenings at your restaurant. On Instagram, you can share stunning food shots and of ambiance from your restaurant\u2019s kitchen and more. Gone are the days of newspaper ads and outdoor advertising. Get online and make the most of what social media has to offer."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/appealing-restaurants-target-customer/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "If you dream of owning and running your own restaurant, the term \u2018target customer\u2019 should be at the top of your planning and conceptualizing. Who is a target customer? One who would enjoy visiting your restaurant for everything it has to offer. It surely is as simple as that, but what goes into building your brand around that? What entails appealing to your target customer? From location to budget, there are a number of factors that determine whether or not you\u2019re appealing to your target customer.\nWhere is your restaurant\u2019s location?\nLocation plays a key role as you might have heard over and over again. You might think it\u2019s a given but you will still see rookie mistakes. Your location has a direct impact on business. Which is why learning about the people in a locality is of primal importance. Are you planning to open or already have a restaurant in a locality where there are colleges around? Are there corporate parks/buildings? Is it a dense residential area? Because with every aspect, the kind of restaurant you have will be different. For example, in a quiet residential area of a metro city, a pub with blaring music doesn\u2019t make sense. A quaint cafe does. If in a similar area, there\u2019s a Chinese restaurant that doesn\u2019t offer home delivery services, it\u2019s going to lose out on a substantial chunk of business. Likewise, in a CBD of a city, a buffet-style restaurant will have advantage over say, a stand-alone fine dine restaurant. Assess the area and look at the kind of people that your restaurant will draw in.\nWhat is your concept?\nGone are the days when you could open a restaurant and serve whatever you felt like. With the kind of restaurants opening today, you\u2019ve got to have an edge and a basic concept that appeals to your target demographic. If your target customer is from the corporate sector working in a tech park or a similar space, you\u2019re looking at someone between the age group of 25-40 who might have lunch out around their office. The frequency might vary depending on the average cost of a meal at a restaurant. The more reasonable it is for them, the more frequent their visits will be. If your establishment is in the vicinity of a college and are targeting college students, keep the ambiance light and fun so the younger customers relate to it. Have games and good music with fun food to go with the concept because that\u2019s what works with your target demographic.\nWhat is your\u00a0price point?\nWith the location and concept narrowed down, have you aligned your pricing with them so your target customer turns into a repeat one? Considering where your restaurant is and what kind of food you\u2019re serving keeping the concept in mind, you must price your dishes accordingly. For example, a cafe near a college with burgers at \n\u20b9500 a pop is off the mark. But if there\u2019s a residential area or a business campus around, it might work.\nWhat is your USP?\nIf your target customers are the working folks from the CBD area in the city, corporate lunches can be a USP. Similarly, if yours is a delivery only place in a residential area, doing a combo meal at a reasonable price can be a USP. Once you have your USP figured out, you can focus on marketing your restaurant for the same. Marketing can then be narrowed down to your target demographic \u2013 online, offline, whichever applies.\nThe idea of appealing to everyone is not ideal\u00a0in today\u2019s world of extreme competition and eating out culture. Restaurants everywhere today are doing more than just serving food. From TV show appearances to bringing in celebrity chefs, marketing their restaurant to bring in more customers and the right ones at that, has been a focus. Aim at your target customer and if your restaurant appeals to everyone else, it\u2019s a bonus!"

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/security-update-what-really-happened-and-what/",
        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "Like we previously posted on our blog \nhere\n and \nhere\n, a part of our infrastructure that was used to store user\u2019s information was breached by an ethical hacker. The data downloaded as a result of this breach contained five data points for 17 million users \u2013 names, emails, numeric user IDs, usernames, and password hashes. The password hashes leak was a little more contained and impacted a subset of 6.6 million users \u2013 all the other users were using Facebook/Google for login \u2013 we don\u2019t have any password information for those accounts.\nThe hacker had listed these data points on a dark web marketplace.\nWe were lucky we could get in touch with the person (hacker) in good time. As it turned out, the hacker was a security researcher (ethical hacker) who had put up the data for sale to get our attention (and/or to teach us a lesson). He/she only wanted us to launch a good bug bounty program on Hackerone, as he/she wanted to make sure that security researchers were rewarded well for their work. The hacker also shared the database with us and took the sales link down once we promised to launch the bug bounty program. He/she also agreed to destroy the data at their end immediately.\nSince we hope no other company faces a breach like we did, we wanted to share our learnings from this incident and hope this is helpful for other growing companies.\nHow did the hacker get access to this data?\nThe hacker explained to us how he/she was able to breach our infrastructure to access a part of our database.\nIt all started in November 2015, when 000webhost\u2019s user database was leaked online (with plain text passwords). One of our developers had his personal hosting account with the service. As a result of 000webhost\u2019s user account data breach, his email address and password also became available publicly.\nUnfortunately, the developer was using the same email and password combination on Github. Back then, when 000webhost passwords leaked, we were not using 2 factor authentication on Github (we have been using two-factor authentication on Github since the last few months). With the login credentials for the developer, the hacker was able to use the developer\u2019s password to get into his Github account and review one of our code repositories to which the developer had access (this happened some time last year, but for some reason the hacker only exploited the code very recently).\nGetting access to a part of the code didn\u2019t give the hacker direct access to the database. Our systems are only accessible for a specific set of IP addresses. But the hacker was able to scan through the code, and he ended up exploiting a vulnerability in the code to access the database (via remote code execution). The piece of code which was vulnerable was a part of a deprecated system, and hadn\u2019t been modified for a few years now.\nYes, someone has some of our code, and that\u2019s a risk. But we have taken every step conceivable to us to make sure that the code cannot be exploited in any way possible to breach Zomato\u2019s infrastructure. Also, one more thought that gives us comfort \u2013 with every passing day, the leaked code is getting more and more out-of-date.\nWhile this is a case of extraordinarily bad luck, we were fortunate enough to resolve this with minimal damage. This incident taught us a good lesson on the importance of security and how we have to be paranoid about it going forward.\nIn hindsight, what helped us contain the extent of the breach?\nOur use of multiple environments, each segregating and containing a part of business ensured that the data breach was limited to only one part of Zomato\u2019s database; and the hacker did not gain access to all the various databases used by different businesses.\nAdditionally, we had made two-factor authentication on Github mandatory a few months back, which cut off the hacker\u2019s access to the developer\u2019s Github account for updated code. The hacker was working off an old code base \u2013 and this code base had changed significantly over the last few months, limiting the extent of data the hacker could access with the copy of the old code base.\nKeeping lines of communication open with the hacker helped us understand his/her motive of the breach and address his/her (very reasonable) demands. This in turn, led to the hacker cooperating with us by pulling down the sales listing from the dark web.\nWe have good network restrictions in place, which ensured that our servers weren\u2019t compromised. Which also means that our payment processing systems which run on a separate secure environment (PCI DSS Level 1 Certified) were never compromised. We have also submitted a compliance report after a detailed assessment to our payment partners \u2013 Visa Inc, and our payment gateway partners.\nHow did this impact the business?\nWe got an overwhelming amount of support from our users. Our traffic and food ordering have been holding flat or growing in the aftermath of the incident. We are thankful and extremely lucky to have a brand/product which people love and are willing to forgive for even some very big mistakes. We really hope we don\u2019t let any of our users down anytime in the future.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nOur team\u2019s commitment to addressing reports for all security issues in a responsible and timely manner has become even stronger. We will continue to follow best practices and learn from the ethical hacker community to make Zomato a safer place for all users.\nWe are also in the process of introducing a monetary reward based bug bounty program on Hackerone very soon.\nWe are actively working to ensure all our systems are secure, and will also continue to invest in securing our users\u2019 data by adopting more stringent security practices.\nWe are also going to invest time and effort in creating a \u201cworking group\u201d of internet companies in India and exchange knowledge about best practices for security. We will also hold meet-ups (like the \nProduct Huddle we conduct in Delhi NCR\n) so that young and large internet companies can get together and learn from each other about security.\nLast thing \u2013 we have since been advised by multiple industry experts to take some action against the developer, in order to \u201cset an example\u201d and \u201cinfluence public perception\u201d. We know that this mishap is on the organisation, and not on an individual. Instead of pinning the responsibility on someone, we are going to use this as a learning opportunity for all of us.\n\u2013 Deepinder & Gunjan"

        "content": "Coffee by Di Bella was founded in 2002 by Phillip Di Bella in Brisbane, Australia. This specialty coffee brand was introduced to India by Rahul Leekha, who grew the brand and passion for coffee among consumers in Mumbai\u2014one store at a time. Today there are 12 Coffee by Di Bella stores across the city. We engaged with Rahul for a freewheeling chat over about what makes Coffee by Di Bella the go-to coffee shop, their products, innovation and more\u2026 over a cup of coffee, of course!\nWhat made you choose India and, more particularly, Mumbai?\nMumbai is one of the fastest growing food hubs in the country. The population is very cosmopolitan; there are a lot of corporates, finance folks, college-goers and even entrepreneurs. And there\u2019s a lot of family crowd too, so it\u2019s a healthy mix. To answer your question, it obviously had to be a metro and Mumbai was the best choice. Besides, I hail from Mumbai so it\u2019s my homeground.\nHow different is it operation wise between the Australian outlets and the ones in Mumbai?\nVery different. The Australian coffee market is advanced. According to me, it\u2019s at least 10-15 years ahead of the Indian market. Over there, you don\u2019t need the fancy freak shakes, waffles and fancy stores. It\u2019s only about the coffee. In any case, every market is different. India is more experience driven, Australia is more takeaway driven. For example, on an average, we would do 600-700 coffees in one cafe between 8 am and 2 pm in Australia. In India, you could never do that many in the mornings. It also makes sense to localize with different markets. But what we get from Australia is the expertise. Coffee by Di Bella is a speciality coffee company. We source beans from across the globe, get them to Australia and create various blends. There are around 15 blends on the portfolio; 4-5 being award winning. Every bean and every blend has a unique taste profile depending on the soil it was grown in and the region it\u2019s from. Getting all these different profiles in one cup of coffee is the expertise that we have.\nAre you also looking at bringing local coffee brands on board?\nNot local brands, because we are strictly committed to buying our coffee from Coffee by Di Bella because they have the expertise. The market here is still at a nascent stage and even a lot of players are in the learning phase. Whereas in Australia, they\u2019ve crossed that learning curve. When we have such an advanced blend in our portfolio, we don\u2019t really have a reason to think of local brands right now. Although, Australia does import Indian coffee beans because of its bold taste and when blended with other beans, it makes for a very good coffee.\nHow is the coffee culture different in Australia compared to India\u2014consumer wise?\nThe Indian consumer is well-traveled as well as well-educated about various products in the market. When we show something to the consumer which they connect with, they are always up for it. Zomato has really helped us in this regard; the ratings of our stores are at 4.4 and 4.6 which is something we\u2019re really proud of. And that\u2019s because whenever we\u2019ve marketed a product, you can see it in the reviews. Our key focus is providing consumers consistent and honest experience. 80% of our footfall are from repeat customers. We\u2019re not out there putting up big billboards to draw people in. Our repeat customers are very important to us. The consumer is very sensible today. Gone are the days when you could be just a brand and serve anything.\n\u201cThe consumer is very sensible today. Gone are the days when you could be just a brand and serve anything.\u201d\nIn recent times we\u2019ve seen that coffee consumption has grown and people taken to learning more about the coffee they drink. Do you think this is a fad?\nIt cannot be a fad because coffee is something that once it grows on you, it grows on you. So far there used to be a chai culture but I believe that culture is moving slowly towards a coffee culture for a simple reason: You can\u2019t go to the same restaurant every day for a cup of tea but you can go to the same cafe everyday. So, that builds the culture; finding that space between your work and home. Had it been a fad, a chain like Cafe Coffee Day wouldn\u2019t have stuck around for 15 years. Even if we see our own stores here, they\u2019ve grown by around 20% year on year. That\u2019s a good indicator of where the industry is moving.\nWhat is your biggest challenge in maintaining the global brand?\nWe work very closely with the Australian stores. As a brand, we don\u2019t have as many limitations a brand would normally impose when they get into a new market. The brand has always been there for us. The challenging aspect has been more local \u2013 giving the right training to staff, to help them understand the culture and so on. We\u2019ve been lucky that way, our attrition has been just 2%. We believe in retaining our people. I give around 70-80% hikes to my team. These guys work almost 14 hours a day. We understand that and try to keep their morale high, and it reflects on consumers as well. The customer is also happy to see familiar faces for the last 3 years. It\u2019s like going to a bar and finding your bartender.\nIf somebody who has no in-depth knowledge about coffee or what running a cafe entails wants to open a cafe, what advice would you give them?\nDon\u2019t work for the landlords. If you\u2019ve observed the coffee industry over the past 3-4 years, brands like Gloria Jeans, Costa Coffee, Bru World have exited. The landscape has become really consolidated. I don\u2019t know why they exited but it suggests that the coffee business is not easy to sustain. The only two (big) reasons why we\u2019ve sustained and are flourishing is because we\u2019ve kept our rent-to-revenue ratios very tight. If a new location doesn\u2019t fit into the business model we\u2019re not going to be tempted to open there. Because we save a good amount on the rent-to-revenue ratio, we invest in the product; importing the coffee, chocolate, serving fresh food, etc. Our money goes into the product as opposed to putting it into the infrastructure. You\u2019ve got to keep your cafe upto mark to a level and customers appreciate that, of course. But they\u2019ll appreciate a honest product even more.\n\u201cIf a new location doesn\u2019t fit into the business model we\u2019re not going to be tempted to open there.\u201d\nWhat are the 3 things one must keep in mind while building a cafe menu?\nYour food needs to be aligned with your coffee palate. For example, over-the-top spicy food won\u2019t go with coffee. Finding the right mix between keeping the food modern and appealing to the Indian palate is important. Whenever we add a new product to the menu, the tasting is always done with coffee on the side, keeping the coffee and the food balance in mind.\nInnovation. Everyone will serve a cappuccino or a macchiato. When we started we realized that not many knew the difference between a mocha, a latte and a cappuccino. Everywhere you go, they serve the same drink with different names. So what we did was, we came up with this innovative idea of introducing crockery which is designed specially per beverage. So, you can clearly differentiate between them. And we\u2019ve patented this. There\u2019s also innovation in food. Two years back, we started the waffle craze. On a bad day we sell around 1000 waffles. And the innovation doesn\u2019t stop there. Last year we started freak shakes which was in collaboration with Tourism Victoria and a chocolatier from Ganache chocolates in Australia who came down and we created this freak shake menu and it went viral without any PR or marketing for it. The first week we sold around 15,000 freakshakes. Innovation is important to build your brand. The fresher the idea, the better. We recently made this speciality coffee menu which was never seen before. There was this product on it called the sparkling cloud which has cotton candy on it and you pour coffee on it. There\u2019s a lot of animation and excitement in it.\nManpower. India is almost getting there but there\u2019s still that backward mentality of \u2018waiter is just a waiter\u2019. If you get the right manpower, even if you\u2019re not there yet with the product and experience, it\u2019s still good. Because that\u2019s the one person who is directly in touch with the customer who can make that difference in experience. The high ratings and good reviews you see on Zomato is because we emphasize on our staff to give customers the best experience and not push for sales. We know our product will bring the customer in, but it\u2019s then up to the store level staff to make sure they have a good experience. That\u2019s also why in reviews you\u2019ll see many of our staff\u2019s names are mentioned.\nYou have some chai options on your menu. Are there any more India centric products you\u2019re looking at launching?\nChai is a very traditional Indian beverage. Initially we didn\u2019t have it on our menu but then there are many people who are only chai drinkers. So why not? But then again we\u2019re not looking at completely localizing our menu. We\u2019d never serve a samosa. We do serve a multigrain chicken and paneer makhni sandwich. We also do seasonal menus; like it\u2019s mango season now so we have an excellent mango based menu. We do it for strawberries too. But we don\u2019t do typical Indian menu. Like I mentioned earlier, we make sure the food goes with the coffee we serve.\nYou also wanted to launch an online store of Di Bella coffee which offers various roasts and blends. Is that happening soon?\nYes. Many of our customers have our coffee and want to take it home. The number of enquiries are increasing which is a good indicator of the product entering homes and offices. We will be launching but our current focus is to launch 25 stores. Towards the end of reaching that 25 mark, we\u2019ll launch the online store. We are planning to launch in Delhi and Bangalore next.\nYour favourite restaurant or cafe in Mumbai?\nYou caught me there! I can\u2019t give you just one. I like Zia at The Oberoi. It\u2019s progressive Indian food. Very subtle and not over the top. A Michelin star chef designed the menu so it\u2019s good to see how Indian food is now moving away from your typical greasy butter chicken and dal. I really like what Social does. They have a good product. Thirdly, it\u2019s Di Bella!\nIf it were solely up to you, what would you change about or add to Coffee by Di Bella?\nThat\u2019s a tough one. Honestly, I think we\u2019re blessed. To improve, I can think of 10 things, but change I really don\u2019t think so. Luckily, we haven\u2019t gotten to phase where we\u2019d say \u201cGuys, we need to change this\u201d. That said, I\u2019d add more speciality coffees and more brewing techniques. We did a masterclass recently, but I don\u2019t think the consumer is ready for something like that. It\u2019s more about commercial coffees and setups these days. If we could change that we could definitely introduce many other things. We just need the right manpower, barista and resources to brew coffee in a controlled environment and procedure."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/5-food-trends-boost-restaurant-sales/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "Food trends don\u2019t always begin at restaurants and reach people. More often than not, they are embraced by restaurants after seeing their popularity among food lovers. Either way, it\u2019s a great way to stay relevant and keep up with your customers. Granted, not every restaurant can pull off a\u00a0\nUnicorn Frappuccino\n but you can always keep yourself updated with the happenings on social media. In Bangalore, for instance, there was a\u00a0\nMillet Fair\n with thousands of people attending it and leaving with bags of various millets and other organic goodies. From food bloggers to fitness freaks, several people are now turning to healthier grains for their carb intake.\nAs a restaurant, making these food items available to people will open a window opportunities for you and make it convenient for your customers. You don\u2019t even have to make it a permanent feature in your menu. Like the Unicorn Frappuccino, which basically is a special, running for only a few days.\nHealthy grains\nAgriculture minister of Karnataka, Krishna Byre Gowda has been going to great lengths to \npromote millets\n in the state. As mentioned earlier, millet is the latest fad and with the ministry, along with top chefs, have been organizing various events to spread awareness about it. Popular food bloggers too are experimenting with millets in their recipes, which has further made the grain gain momentum in the food circle in the country. Accordingly, restaurants are including them in their specials or healthy food sections so more people are aware of the options they have to make healthy choices. With fitness gurus also preaching the goodness of moving to healthier grains like millets, looks like this trend is here to stay.\nFarmers\u2019 markets/bazaar\nThis isn\u2019t particularly a new concept but has been slow to catch on. However, with today\u2019s consumer being aware of what they eat, it is a great way of bringing people into your restaurant\u2019s premises. It is as simple as getting local cheese makers, organic farmers and others who have their own small businesses of local and organic produce and other goods to come set up up shop at your restaurant\u2019s bazaar. Make it a monthly event and see how customers will look forward to attending it. A little shopping and a lot more eating makes for a great day.\nTasting menus\nYou don\u2019t need to be a big fancy restaurant to have tasting menus. If pubs can have a tasting menu for their beers, maybe your restaurant can too. There was once a biryani restaurant in Bangalore in the early 2000s called Biryani Merchant that did a small tasting menu for customers which comprised three kinds of their biryani for a set price. After which one could order their favourite kind. That\u2019s one way of going about it. If not, simply stick to a tasting menu for a fixed price where you give customers a variety of dishes in small (tasting) portions which may include chef\u2019s specials or signature dishes. If your restaurant is popular for desserts or if you have a casual cafe style establishment, then you could do a tasting menu for dessert. Lots of options are out there for you work with.\nPhotogenic dishes\nWe recently wrote about\n how dishes at restaurant can be made photogenic\n so customers are excited to share pictures on \nZomato\n, Instagram and other social media platforms. You can open any of these sites to see a plethora of gorgeous dishes which make them very popular with the younger folks. Even simple dishes like tikkas and risottos are made to look great so their pictures wind up on the internet. More photos means more visibility for your brand and by extension more customers. Not just the food, but drinks can be made photogenic too. Special cocktails with pretty garnishes in quirky looking glasses are definitely winners.\nNew cuisines\nHold on. We\u2019re not suggesting you change your menu, but adding a couple of new dishes in your specials from another cuisine (if your style of restaurant/menu has room for it) may bring in curious customers. If you\u2019re already serving multiple cuisines, bringing in a couple of special dishes will only be good for business. A fine way to incorporate such dishes with context would be to try including seasonal produce in them. Mangos, for instance, are in season. Mango special desserts from different cuisines for sure sounds like a must-try.\n\u2014\nAll of these little tricks are definitely something you can try at your restaurant. But unless you spread the word via social media and advertising, no one\u2019s going to know about them. If you can manage to get your customers\u2019 foot in the door, you have this in the bag already."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/5-ways-make-restaurant-menu-better/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "It\u2019s an interesting question and has been answered differently over the years. We too have touched on ways to \nmake your menu more effective\n and about \nupdating your current menu\n. Let\u2019s talk about how we can make it better. What is \u2018better\u2019 in this case? Better would be doing anything to make life easy for your customers while ordering food, keeping your menu relevant and ensuring you see customers order various dishes instead of the few standard best selling ones.\nYour menu is the soul of your restaurant. It encompasses every element of what your restaurant represents. All other factors are great to bring people in and turn into customers. But your menu and the food is what will bring them back many times over. And you can do wonders to your current menu without adding anything to it or making any drastic changes.\nHighlighting dishes\nUnless your restaurant is like \nBrahmin\u2019s Coffee Bar\n with just about a handful of dishes that are all popular, you should have dishes on your menu that need to be highlighted. Be it chef\u2019s special, signature or just a few dishes that you\u2019d want to recommend the customer to try. If you look at the business side of things and don\u2019t intervene with the food, sit with your chef and understand the dishes you should be highlighting. Your chef will tell you their strengths and all you need to do is place it right in your menu so it grabs customers\u2019 eyeballs. The top right and the centre of a menu are more likely to get attention from the customer and those are the spots you should place your signature dishes in. You could place it right under the title of the section or even highlight it with a star or a chef\u2019s hat symbol. Be subtle and the customer will get the message.\nPrecise descriptions\n\u201cHand cut\u201d or \u201chand battered\u201d things are simply pretentious and doesn\u2019t add anything special to the dish. Words like \u201csumptuous\u201d and \u201cdelectable\u201d don\u2019t mean anything to your customer either. Oh, even the \u201ccooked to perfection\u201d doesn\u2019t do much because, well, that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do \u2013 cook it to perfection. Don\u2019t make your descriptions look like you\u2019re trying too hard. Simple yet precise ways to explain what the dish always works. What you should be doing is, keeping the descriptions short, precise and with suitable adjectives. For example, \u201ctender chicken pieces simmered\u00a0in coconut broth laced with warm spices\u201d is a lot more appealing and gives the customer an idea of what the dish would be like as opposed to \u201csucculent chicken cooked\u00a0in coconut broth with fresh hand pounded spices\u201d. Don\u2019t simply leave the dish to their imagination with \u201cenough said\u201d or \u201cno need to tell you what this is\u201d. If all of this seems like much to handle, hire a copywriter who\u2019ll be able to communicate the exact message to your customers.\nGrouping foods\nThis isn\u2019t new for you. But take a good look at your menu to see if you\u2019ve been grouping all your dishes correctly. There\u2019s the classic \u2013 appetizers/starters, salads, soups, main course and desserts. Another kind breaks it down further by grouping proteins \u2013 poultry, seafood, vegetables and so on. Depending on the kind of establishment yours is, this kind of grouping will help customers make decisions easily. You can place your signature dishes in line with these groups too. For pubs and bars, it\u2019s best to go with the current trend of small plates, big plates, mains and the bar menu. Your patrons come in groups and look for easy bar eats, only the portions vary. If you structure your menu accordingly, both parties benefit from it.\nLayout basics\nPlease hire a consultant who works with restaurant menus and understands what size, colours, fonts and placement of dishes mean, and how they all affect a customer\u2019s psyche. If you don\u2019t want a consultant, understand what your needs are and hire an illustrator (there are so many young independent ones today) to get the job done. Even your blackboard menu can be made more attractive with some colour and interesting font. Keep in mind your branding and all the colours you use in the restaurant and in its name. Use few of them to highlight dishes on the blackboard to draw eyes. Specials menu on the blackboard is a lot more appealing than a waiter rattling it all to the customer. You can read more about how colours affect appetite here.\n\u2014\nIn short, restructure and clean up your menu without adding dishes to it to make it more appealing to your customers. It\u2019ll help the menu get fresh new look to show off your best dishes and get people to order more and different dishes."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/attract-customers-restaurant/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "With people\u2019s fleeting attention and growing\u00a0appetite, restaurateurs are investing more time and money on making their restaurants more appealing to customers. There isn\u2019t just any one element of a restaurant that makes it more attractive. It\u2019s like a package deal with all senses coming into play. It isn\u2019t enough just to have good food, you have got to work on what the restaurant looks like, the\u00a0kind of crowd you want to attract, the smell in your restaurant, service and everything in between.\nBut there are little things you can do to make changes around your space to have more people pay attention. Instead of sitting back and thinking it\u2019s just the slow season or the market is down or that newer restaurants are taking your share of business, get working on your own.\nYou might not think much of it as a restaurant owner but what exactly is your restaurant\u2019s vibe? You might have\u00a0\ngotten the concept right\n, but to bring more people in, you need go beyond what is obvious. Look at the cool and hip restaurants, bars and cafes today. Some of them have such strong following that their loyal patrons are at their place a few times a week. The key is to create a vibe that draws people in and gets them to come over repeatedly, share the restaurant\u2019s ambiance and food shots on social media, have an impact with visuals, sounds and smells for your restaurant to be customers\u2019 go-to place.\nLook and feel\nAmbiance is the first thing a customer comes face to face with as soon as they step into a restaurant. Be it a small cafe or a hipster pub, making a statement and standing out will set you apart from the rest. A small cafe like\u00a0\nMadison & Pike\n in Gurgaon has a very rustic yet classic American feel to it. Even tiny details like wall paintings, a red brick wall and something as simple as the font the cafe\u2019s name is in are almost etched in customers\u2019 minds. You don\u2019t need to redecorate entirely, but include a few pieces of fun, quirky or even simple items in your cafe/restaurant that people might take notice of like posters, artifacts, vintage Indian household items and the likes. Lighting is also a part of the ambiance. Depending on the kind of establishment, adjust the lighting accordingly. For example if yours is a cafe, ample natural light works beautifully. If there\u2019s no source of natural light, try adding some light fixtures with bright yellow light to make up for it. Today\u2019s version of word-of-mouth is sharing pictures on \nZomato\n, Instagram, Facebook\u00a0and other platforms. To have your restaurant\u2019s pictures on these platforms means more people looking at them and more chances of them coming over.\nMusic and noises\nWhy \u2018sounds\u2019 and why not just \u2018music\u2019? Because music is not the only sound customers hear. With a busy restaurant, sometimes with food, even sounds pour out of the kitchen. It is generally quite off putting when that happens. Granted everybody knows how a professional kitchen can be, but nobody wants to hear it. Occasionally someone from the staff losing their cool or even loud customers can make anyone\u2019s experience unpleasant. Similarly, at a cafe when the music gets too loud, it can drive customers away. Cafes are meant for coffee and conversation, if nothing else. For loud music, people go to bars and pubs and that\u2019s not what they need in cafes. And while we\u2019re talking about music, it isn\u2019t only the volume, but also the kind of music played at restaurants that can add or take away from a customer\u2019s experience.\nService and other nice things\nIf ambiance is what brings them in,\u00a0\nservice\n will bring them in again. You might roll your eyes thinking, \u201cOh, not this. Not again.\u201d But think of the mistakes you\u2019re doing in the name of good service. One that stands out in many restaurants today is the wait staff being way too attentive, hovering over diners\u2019 asking them after every second bite how everything was going. It can be a tad overbearing. Customers won\u2019t tell them to back off upright but that is certainly no reason to keep going. Learn to observe from a distance and go to them when it appears that they may need some help. Staff needs to be friendly, warm and show customers a good time without bothering them. Ask them if they had a good time or if the food was good once they\u2019re done. That indeed is polite and courteous, not refilling their glass after every sip of their drink.\nSharing and spreading the word\nIt\u2019s not just your customers, but you should be sharing restaurant updates on social media as well. If not you, the restaurant owner, it should be the restaurant\u2019s manager or even the chef. The Bombay Canteen is a good example where Chef Zachery shares constant updates online about the restaurant\u2019s happenings. From new dishes to staff meals, people get a peek on what the restaurant is up to. It also creates a warm and friendly vibe that makes people want to drop by. Always spread the word about the fun stuff at your restaurant. Show how excited you are about a new gadget or the new menu, or even a vegetable that\u2019s in season. That way you\u2019ll also stay relevant and in your customers\u2019 minds.\n\u2014\nPeople love eating out and they\u2019re always looking for new places almost every week. It\u2019s the hook that will keep them coming to yours. Your restaurant\u2019s decor, food and service are a part of the hook, but you must show your customers how they can have a good time at your place. Now THAT is the real hook."

While we\u2019re lining up the launch of Zomato Gold in India in a couple of months, we wanted to start off by introducing something for our food ordering users in India first.\nHow, you might ask? With the aptly titled \nZomato Treats\n, a subscription-based service for Zomato users in India as well as the UAE. If you live in any of the 16 cities where we offer online food delivery, a Zomato Treats subscription will get you a FREE dessert with every meal you order online on Zomato at participating restaurants.\nIf the child in you is jumping with joy, well, it should \ud83d\ude42\nFurthermore, the subscription isn\u2019t limited to a single city \u2013 you can use it if you\u2019re ordering online in any of the 16 cities where we will eventually have Treats. Just because you aren\u2019t home, doesn\u2019t mean you should miss out on dessert. We\u2019ll be rolling this out to everyone in phases over the next few weeks. Starting now, 20% of our users in Gurgaon will have the option to buy Zomato Treats and make life sweeter than before.\nHaving a sweet tooth isn\u2019t such a bad thing now, is it? \ud83d\ude42"

        "content": "\u201cIt\u2019s not how much we give but how much love we put into giving.\u201d \u2013 Mother Teresa\nIn the past, we\u2019ve tried to do our bit to help the community, and the support we\u2019ve received for our efforts from our restaurant partners and users has always been nothing short of amazing. Just over 12 months ago, we were able to accomplish \nthis\n and then \nthis\n in Chennai, thanks to thousands of people coming together and using Zomato to help others who were stuck in the floods. The outpouring of support we got from our users thanking us for the opportunity created by our platform to lend their support to a worthy cause, was as inspiring as it was humbling.\nWe pray that such things never happen again.\nBut all this time, we\u2019ve been thinking about how Zomato can bring people together and help them contribute towards a common cause. The right time to drive change is when everything is running smoothly, rather than only reacting when disaster strikes.\nBuilding on that thought, we\u2019re setting something more enduring in motion \u2013 an ongoing initiative we\u2019re calling \n\u2018Turn the Tables\u2019\n. Think of it as our way of bringing millions of Zomato users, our thousands of restaurant partners, and our team together with our shared love of food, to help tackle challenges that many of our friends and loved ones face in their daily lives.\nThe first edition of \nTurn the Tables\n is focused on a cause much of the world is working towards \u2013 helping cancer patients; more specifically, raising awareness about the disease and providing aid for cancer research. With 454.8 new cases of cancer and 171.2 deaths per 100,000 men and women each year, it\u2019s evident that fighting to find a cure for this illness is an uphill battle.\nWe understand the sheer magnitude of the problem, but we want to do our bit, and felt we had to start somewhere. So we reached out to restaurants across \nDelhi\n, \nMumbai\n, and \nBangalore\n, and \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 received an overwhelming response from a large number of them. And this is where our users come in. From the \n7th to the 16th of April\n, these partner restaurants will be offering specially designed set menus. For every guest who dines in support of the cause, \u20b9100 will go towards our partner NGOs \u2013 \nCancer Patients Aid Association (CPAA)\n, and \nKarunashraya\n, who do excellent work providing aid and treatment to cancer patients.\nHundreds of Zomato users have already made bookings online in support of this 10-day long event, which is the first of many more to follow. At the time of writing this, we\u2019ve already raised \n\u20b92.86 Lakhs\n, and counting. It\u2019s a small start, but a start nonetheless, and we\u2019re very excited about the next few days. Amazing things happen when the community comes together, and we know we can expect a lot more people joining in and doing their bit to help the cause."

        "content": "Kainaz Messman is the brain, sweat and passion behind \nTheobroma\n. From helping her mother out in her catering business when she was a little girl to building a patisserie empire of her own, Kainaz has indeed come a long way. She believes her experiences have only made her a strong entrepreneur. In a freewheeling chat with us, Kainaz reveals how it all started, where it\u2019s headed and everything in between.\nHow did it all start?\nI was a chef with the Oberoi group of hotels. But before I even thought of becoming a chef, my mother had her own home catering business, and I\u2019d help her out after school. My mother was one of the first people to bake a brownie in the city, and this was back in the \u201880s when people hadn\u2019t even heard of brownies. It wasn\u2019t the age of the internet and the only connection we had to these things were the few books that my mother had. And every \nSunday\n, she\u2019d make new things for us despite being very busy, like gazpacho and jambalaya. When I decided to become a pastry chef during my visit to France as a youth exchange student, it was easier for me than for my batch mates. More so because I was already exposed to a variety of food thanks to my mum. It was easy for me to grasp techniques and French culinary terms. Eventually, I joined the Oberoi hotels as a pastry chef but since my family was entrepreneurial, they pushed me to start my own business and that\u2019s how my mom and I started Theobroma.\nYou said in an interview once that when you start something of your own, you should do it for the right reasons. What were those reasons for you?\nSimply put, I loved what I did! It is a privilege to be able to choose what you want to do in life. Many people don\u2019t get to choose, they have to work out of necessity to support their families and to make ends meet. People like us, who come from privileged backgrounds, are fortunate enough to choose what we want to do. However, we have to be very clear that this is where we\u2019re meant to be. And it\u2019s a passion that you have to cultivate for the rest of your life. Owning your own business has lots of advantages but it\u2019s also a responsibility. And people shouldn\u2019t think for a second that since you\u2019re the owner, you can sit back and take it easy. On the contrary you will work harder and longer hours, and do things you never thought you\u2019d do. I didn\u2019t want to clean drains or my shop bathroom but I had to as I couldn\u2019t afford staff at that point in time. When it\u2019s your own business, despite your passion for cooking, you can\u2019t limit yourself to only one aspect. For years, I had to be a waiter, a cleaner, cashier \u2013 whatever the business demanded. People look at us in the media, at social events, accepting awards \u2013 sorry, but that\u2019s only the glamorous part of it. The hard truth is the unglamorous part that happens on a daily basis when you\u2019re not at an awards function or sipping on a glass of champagne.\nThe hard truth is the unglamorous part that happens on a daily basis when you\u2019re not at an awards function or sipping on a glass of champagne.\nWhat has been the most challenging aspect of your job?\nAt different phases, there were different challenges and at that point they seemed like the toughest thing. But now when I look back I feel like I\u2019m much stronger and better because of them. Sometimes everyday felt like a great challenge. I remember when we started out, the oven\u2019s glass broke on the second day of operation. That felt like the worst day. Four days before Diwali, the BMC broke my kitchen and the shop was empty. That felt like the greateset challenge. We take one step at a time. We overcame terrible days because we\u2019ve stuck together as a family and ploughed on. But the upside is that there are wonderful days. Like, when a little boy or an old lady comes up and tells you \u201cI love Theobroma\u201d, or a mum and a child enjoying a piece of cake; those are the best days.\nHow was it to open in Delhi? And what was the biggest difference in the two cities for you?\nVery challenging. There were many factors \u2013 new city, new people, different ingredients, weather. Even though we did enough market research, there still is a difference. And we were in no way prepared for the unprecedented demand that our shop had. And the biggest differences in the two cities were flour and sugar for me.\nYou have shops in Mumbai and Delhi. Have you thought of opening in a tier two city?\nYes, most definitely. Again, we take one step at a time. When we were just in Mumbai, we used to courier all our products all over the country. The one place that the most number of orders came from was Delhi. That\u2019s why we felt that we owe it to our customers over there. I believe we must do the metros first because there\u2019s a lot of demand from Kolkata and Bangalore as well. We\u2019d also like to open two more shops in Delhi. There\u2019s so much to do and we don\u2019t want to bite off more than we can chew. So, we\u2019ll take it as it comes.\nThere was a time when brownies weren\u2019t as big as they are now. Similarly, molecular gastronomy is a big trend these days. Do you see any product or any trend in desserts happen in the future?\nI think desserts are becoming less sweeter worldwide and becoming more local. Also, personally, I am not fond of the current trend of molecular gastronomy. It\u2019s just not me. I love classics and I believe they should be executed well. And that\u2019s where the soul of desserts lie. For example, no matter where you go in the world, no matter how fancy a dessert you have, most people will give anything for a piece of their grandma\u2019s cake. It\u2019s comfort food. And Theobroma wants to be that and not extra fancy. We just want to make good desserts.\nFor example, no matter where you go in the world, no matter how fancy a dessert you have, most people will \u00a0give anything for a piece of their grandma\u2019s cake.\nAre you planning to introduce any kind of healthy desserts bearing in mind that many people are becoming more health conscious these days?\nNo. I think everybody should be healthy. But your life philosophy should be that everything should be had in moderation. Why deny yourself of the pleasure of eating a good chocolate cake? Don\u2019t eat it everyday, but every once in a while.\nWhat is the processes of introducing\u00a0a new dish or dessert?\nThere\u2019s a lot that goes on behind the scene. 90% of the trials don\u2019t even make it to the front. I have a few ingredients I like to work with and create different combinations. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don\u2019t. We like to take popular combinations so more people can enjoy it. I know that Indians love nuts, so I\u2019ll always try and make something with nuts in chocolate or make a classic cheesecake with a local fruit. Now we\u2019re in the mango season and we\u2019ll celebrate it in every way \u2013 be it with our tarts, cheesecakes, mousse or pastry. And sometimes we fall flat on our face and sometimes we don\u2019t. Invention is important but we also have to retain the soul of the food. I work together with my chefs, we discuss, we debate and we send these trials to some of our old customers for feedback. If it all works out, we introduce it in the shop.\nAs a woman what are the challenges you have faced in this business?\nI think women in the kitchen are still a minority, not only in India but worldwide. Mostly because the kitchen is a more physically demanding place, there are longer hours and it\u2019s emotionally high strung (and things are heavy in the kitchen!). Of course, then you have to prove yourself. But it\u2019s definitely getting better compared to the era I started out. Women are more acceptable and taken more seriously in the kitchen now. The challenges women face are the same as they\u2019d face anywhere else. Time and again we\u2019re are subject to mental, emotional and physical harassment but it\u2019s gotten a lot better because organizations are waking up to it. At least my organization is taking care so these kind of instances don\u2019t happen or if it did, we make sure prompt and strict action is taken so the person wouldn\u2019t even dare to enter the shop again.\nFrance has had a very big influence in your life. How is the dessert culture in France different from India? Can it be brought to India?\nVery different. Dessert is a part of everyday life there. Most French people have sweet breakfast be it jam, butter and toast or yoghurt with honey and fruit. Sometimes for dessert, they just have a fruit like, a fresh peach plucked from their garden or from the farmers\u2019 market. They don\u2019t gorge on it or wait for an occasion to have dessert. They have everything but in moderation.\nTheobroma is not your high-end patisserie, it\u2019s your everyday go-to-place; be it for a loaf of bread, or a croissant, or a pastry. The idea is wherever there\u2019s a Theobroma, you can go down in your pyjamas and pick out something. That\u2019s also how the French relate to baking and pastry in their life. I\u2019d love to imbibe that culture in here. I want people to come to Theobroma because it\u2019s their neighbourhood go to place and not just for a treat.\nLastly, how is technology helping your business?\nIt is helping us reach a wider audience and it\u2019s helping us get more honest feedback. Because people might hesitate to talk to you in person, but \nwhen they write a review on Zomato\n, they are more candid and that helps. It makes you wake up and forces you to look at someone\u2019s perspective. We may not agree with them and sometimes people are unfair or biased, but most often, the feedback is genuine. Only if you listen to your customers, business will thrive. You can\u2019t do whatever you want. You are in this industry for your customers."

        "content": "\u201cEnergy and persistence conquer all things.\u201d \u2013\n Benjamin Franklin\nDisclaimer : all numbers in this \u201cshort form\u201d annual report are unaudited. Exact numbers might change in small deltas while we go through the audit.\nIf I have to define the last year for Zomato in just two words, these will be perseverance and focus. All of us at Zomato simply put our heads down to execute.\nFY16 (ending March 2016), a year ago, wasn\u2019t ideal for us despite having achieved 2x revenue growth over FY15. That\u2019s because our cash burn was very high at an average of $4.2m a month.\nAlong with the burn rate, we were also in the middle of consolidating/ rationalising our international operations to make better use of our execution bandwidth moving forward. We had just come out of the layoffs in some of our international markets, and our team\u2019s morale wasn\u2019t in the best shape. Additionally, back then, we were very new to the transactions space (online food ordering) and there was a lot to learn in order to stay ahead of competition.\nWe believe we executed reasonably well in the last year, in spite of the hard challenges in front of us. There\u2019s still a lot to learn. Our March 2017 revenue is $5m, helping us exit the last financial year at a $60m/year revenue run rate. We achieved $49m in revenue in FY17, a growth of ~80% over FY16.\nAlong with a growth in revenue, we also reduced our annual operating burn from $64m in FY \u201816 to $12m in FY\u201917 ($75m losses reported last year included a significant amount of non-operating burn i.e. non-cash items \u2013 depreciation, amortization and non cash provisions).\nRight now, the average monthly cash burn for the period of December 2016 \u2013 March 2017 is a little less than $250k globally, down from $4.2m last March; and we\u2019re well on our way to hit profitability.\nMeanwhile, we beefed up our focus on product, engineering and traffic growth, helping our overall traffic and engagement numbers immensely. Here\u2019s how our March 2017 traffic and engagement numbers stack up against March 2016.\nAll this time, while we were focused on reducing burn, and ramping up revenue, we didn\u2019t compromise or cut down on any growth engines. In fact, the last 12 months saw the most amount of innovation coming out of Zomato. \nHere are a few things which happened in the last year \u2013\nRe-designing our ads model\nIn mid 2016, we redesigned our ad serving product to drive more value to our users as well as merchants. For starters, we stopped accepting advertising from low rated restaurants, so that our users only see the best that\u2019s out there. The new product provided smarter targeting, simpler interface and greater visibility to our well rated advertisers. We rolled this out globally by September 2016 and helped our merchants realise a ~3x increase in value from advertising on Zomato. Our ad sales revenue grew to ~$38m in FY17.\nWe also further enhanced the efficacy of our sales team, which led to over 83% growth in productivity (revenue/headcount) in our ads business.\nScaling up food ordering (delivery); introducing Zomato Infrastructure Services\nOur food ordering team worked simultaneously on multiple fronts \u2013 user onboarding, experience, and retention along with restaurateur experience and real time payment settlements. All these initiatives helped in further enhancing our efficiency and helped in hitting 2.1 million monthly order volume in March, while keeping our unit economics positive.\nRead more about our food ordering unit economics \nhere\n.\nOur customer delight (support) team didn\u2019t shy away from taking a non-orthodox approach when it came to transform hungry users to happy users, and this reflected in our average order ratings and user cohorts. Our user cohorts look quite like a \u2018smile\u2019 \u2013 which is the holy grail of user cohorts. User retention and increasing frequency is so good that even if we don\u2019t acquire any new users in April 2017, we will still grow 8% over our March volume.\nOur food ordering revenue grew to ~$9m in FY\u201917, 8x of FY16. We are now present in 13 cities in India, and 3 cities in UAE. Middle East is very high on adoption for Zomato, and we are preparing for launching food ordering in Beirut, the Paris of Middle East.\nThe above wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the cooperation of our restaurateur network. Our team worked closely with our merchants and resolved the recurring issues on ground, resulting in very low order rejections, more timely deliveries and, consequently, higher order ratings.\nWe also launched our first cloud kitchen in Delhi NCR which can potentially give a huge boost to our online food ordering business. You can read more about that \nhere\n.\nIntroducing Table Reservations\nOn the back of our increased user engagement levels, we launched Table reservations product in July 2016, and became the market leaders in India and UAE within a month of launch. Currently we have the table reservation option across 24,000 restaurants in 12 cities. In the month of March, we seated 600k guests via our table reservations product.\nRead how we grew in our table reservations business in our blog post \u2013 \n\u201cThe real value of discount-based customer acquisition strategy\u201d\n.\nLaunching Zomato Gold\nWe also launched a premium membership programme, Zomato Gold, in Lisbon and Dubai in March 2017. The willingness of restaurants to get on board, and the whopping response from users assures us we are on the right track, and see a long, fulfilling journey ahead.\nRead the blog post for launch of Zomato Gold in \nDubai\n and \nLisbon\n.\nBeta-testing Zomato Base\nOur Point of Sale product is finally starting to take shape, and is undergoing paid beta trials at over ~200 restaurants of various types and sizes. The upcoming year should definitely see increased adoption of Zomato Base by restaurants across India, UAE and beyond.\n\u2013\nOver the last year, the composition of our senior leadership team has evolved for the better, and we have been able to successfully integrate some new people into key roles within the organisation. For example, Mukund Kulashekaran is leading our food ordering business, Gaurav Gupta is leading our Table Reservations business. Samir Kuckreja is leading Zomato Base. We also very recently welcomed our new President and COO, Deepak Gulati (ex-CEO Tata Docomo) to Zomato.\n\u2013\nOverall, we are in a good place now. The team is hungry for moonshots, and is keeping its head down, learning and executing well. Of course, there\u2019s always a lot more ahead of us and we all truly believe that we are only 1% done.\nStay tuned for an upcoming blog post by Deepinder \u2013 \u201cLearnings from 2016\u201d.\n\u00a0We realised Deepinder is never going to get around to writing this, so please don\u2019t stay tuned!\nImportant note : this is all the data we can and will share for now. Info Edge is a significant public shareholder, therefore we will need to refrain from sharing any information outside the public domain (i.e. our blog)."

Yes we had a blueprint in place, and a dedicated team that enjoys tough challenges, but we were still\u2026 what\u2019s the word\u2026 hungry? Hungry to learn and know more. Until we stepped into the river, we wouldn\u2019t know how cold it was. At the same time, we knew we were capable of achieving what we were setting out to achieve. Since then, we\u2019ve managed to meet expectations in a lot of ways.\nIn the month of March (2017), with a little more than a day to go, we have processed 2m online food orders through Zomato.\nThe journey from 1m orders to 2m orders was a hard one, and we learnt a lot about what matters and what doesn\u2019t. Here are some of the ways we got here \u2013\nBetter customer retention \u2013 a million small things, which ended up compounding towards the current milestone.\nManiacal focus on customer support. We introduced a new \u201cmotto\u201d for our customer support team \u2013 \u201cevery meal matters\u201d. Since then, the customer support team has been very proactive about every single order that goes through Zomato, and our users are loving us even more than before.\nEffective and faster customer acquisition at negligible cost (our marketing budget for food ordering still hovers around $50k per month).\nWe increased the restaurant supply available on Zomato from 12,000 restaurants a few months ago to 18,000 today.\nHere are some more numbers which might interest you \u2013\nMarch will grow ~23%+ over February\nBy platform, Android contributes ~48%, iPhone ~36% and Web ~16%\nAverage order value is ~INR 430 for India and ~AED 62 for UAE\nThe share of restaurant-delivered orders is close to 90%\nAverage delivery time is approximately 38 minutes\nAverage commission rates of ~8.5% (for restaurant-delivered orders)\nUnit economics are very positive and our net margins on an order are ~55%\nOnline food ordering contributes ~20% revenue to our overall topline\nWe have a great team building our food ordering business. This milestone is a testimony to the quality, focus, and persistence of our team here.\nWhich brings us to the most important part \u2013 our users and restaurateur partners who make everything possible. Without the former\u2019s trust in us, there would be no reason to better ourselves. Without the latter\u2019s belief in us, there would be no variety to look forward to. I take this opportunity to wholeheartedly thank everyone for their unwavering faith in us.\nLastly, there are many more millions to come. We are now the leading food ordering platform in India and UAE. We are also the largest food search/discovery platform in 13 countries outside of India. It is humbling for us to have a shot at building the first truly global consumer internet brand, born and brought up in India. With your continuing love and feedback, we will get there very soon.\n\ud83d\ude4c"

It\u2019s been just a week since we soft launched Zomato Gold in Dubai, and the initial response we have seen from our users has been staggering. \nBut first, what is Zomato Gold?\nQuite simply, it is a membership program for a premium nightlife experience in the cities of Dubai and Abu Dhabi \u2013\nIt lets you enjoy up to two rounds of 1+1 on any beverage at many top restaurants, bars and lounges.\nYou can enjoy Gold benefits any time and on any day of the week. Happy hours just got that much longer.\nUsers can buy a 3-month, a 6-month, or a 12-month membership plan. The introductory prices right now start at as low as AED 99\nThere are more than 200 premium Gold partners (restaurants, bars and lounges) to choose from, located in popular areas such as JLT, Barsha, DIFC, Downtown Dubai, Trade Centre, Deira, and pretty much all over Dubai and Abu Dhabi.\nA single membership plan for Dubai and Abu Dhabi.\nWe have made sure that there\u2019s a Gold partner within 3 kilometers of anywhere in Dubai or Abu Dhabi.\nYour membership will let you visit any of the Gold partner restaurants that you like on any given day/time, and you can visit each partner more than once.\nWhat we personally love about Gold is how much you end up saving. The 1+1 benefit can get you 4 drinks for the price of 2 at any of our partners on a single visit, and thus double the value. We also love the fact that Gold is applicable even during peak hours on weekends.\nTo check out Zomato Gold, download/open the Zomato app, change your location to Dubai (if you aren\u2019t already there), and look out for the \u201cIntroducing Zomato Gold\u201d banner on your home screen.\nWhat makes Gold special?\nUnlike any other similar product out there, we focused very heavily on making Gold the most extensive and convenient dining membership program out there.\nZomato Gold has the widest possible range of partner restaurants, bars and lounges \u2013 200+ so far, and we\u2019re going to keep adding to them.\nWe made sure that most of these places are the top-rated places on Zomato\nThere\u2019s no restriction on the drinks you can order with your membership. The entire drinks menu is yours to choose from.\nGold is ultra convenient to use \u2013 there\u2019s no need to punch in anything on your phone or scan QR codes. Just one tap on the partner restaurant\u2019s page on the Zomato app, and you are all set.\nIf you live in Dubai, or travel there often, we hope this product appeals to you. We look forward to you becoming a member. Open your Zomato app to do just that.\nWhen will Zomato Gold arrive in other cities?\nGold will arrive in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore somewhere around June. We will decide launch dates for other international cities depending on what we learn over the next few weeks/months. Our Melbourne, Jo\u2019burg, and Istanbul teams are waiting eagerly to launch Zomato Gold in their cities \ud83d\ude47\ud83c\udffc .\nAny questions?\nPlease email gold@zomato.com\nPS\nIf you use Zomato Gold for alcoholic drinks, please drink responsibly, and don\u2019t be a jerk.\nZomato Gold launched in Lisbon already with a membership program to get 1+1 on food, not on drinks. The blog post (in Portuguese) for our Lisbon launch was published two weeks ago \nhere\n."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/tips-smart-food-truck-menu/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "If you thought food trucks drove into the food scene just a couple of years ago, you are wrong. They\u2019ve been around for over a 100 years. According to this New York Times article, one of the first trucks (or as in this case a wagon) can be traced back as far as 1872 to a guy selling coffee, pies and sandwiches to journalists outside a local newspaper office in Rhode Island. India isn\u2019t new to the concept of food sales from a vehicle. We\u2019ve all grown up seeing vendors on the sidewalk with their carts full of fruits, vegetables and even snacks.\nFood trucks became cool in 2008 when Korean BBQ and Mexican taco trucks were seen around in Los Angeles. It didn\u2019t take much time for Indian entrepreneurs to take notice of it and park their own trucks at the neighbourhood nook. From dosa to BBQ, Indian food trucks have exploded in the food scene making room for more food. However, with the kind of temperatures and food choices around, it\u2019s not always easy to hit the mark. Particularly with the menu. You can\u2019t please everyone, of course. But you need to find your kind of audience who\u2019d appreciate your menu.\n1. Scan the area\nYou would probably do this during the initial days of setting up your food truck. It\u2019s important to scout for a good location not just for the convenience of parking or for large numbers of people, but also to ensure your truck is a hit. When you run a check on the kind of people in the area, age group and the frequency of them eating out, it narrows your menu options further down. If it\u2019s an area where there are a number of offices with people between 22 and 40 heading out for lunch more often than not, you know your menu should be suited to such a group.\n2. Be precise and practical\nIt\u2019s not a restaurant where you have a big kitchen and a bigger dining area with patient customers who have the time to wait for 20 minutes per dish. It\u2019s a food truck with limited resources, a tiny make-do kitchen and impatient customers who are standing there without anything else to do waiting for their food. Once you know what cuisine you want to serve, don\u2019t get carried away. Work around how you can make a crisp and short menu with some of the best dishes you can serve conveniently. Have a set of base ingredients you can use in multiple dishes.\n3. Pricing is everything\nWhy do you think food trucks have become as popular as they have? Food on the go, quick, (relatively) cheap and delicious food. Pricing is key here. If you\u2019re going to charge for a sandwich what a restaurant or cafe charges then what\u2019s the point? The idea is to strike gold without keeping the prices too high or even too low. It\u2019s that sweet spot that works for you and your customers. \u20b9180 for a main and say \u20b9100 for rice or noodles won\u2019t quite cut it out. Instead make it a bowl meal with the main and rice together at maybe \u20b9200 to make it more appealing.\n4. Pack it right\nOne of the best things about food trucks is that meals are convenient. Eat food off a styrofoam plate or plastic bowls and dispose it once you\u2019re done. Even better when the disposable crockery and cutlery is biodegradable. Don\u2019t forget portion control and the fact that it\u2019s not a restaurant setting where you have big bowls of rice and curries for people to share. With food trucks you\u2019re looking at individual portions in convenient packaging.\n5. What you can avoid\n\u2013 Too long a menu leaving the customer confused which comes in the way of convenience.\n\u2013 If you\u2019re going to have pictures of your food on the menu, your truck or even as a standee, make sure you invest in high resolution pictures. A pixelated food shot is quite unappetizing.\n\u2013 Boring food. There are sandwiches everywhere. How you make yours different, will tip the scales in your direction.\n\u2013 Complications like heavy descriptions of the dishes, unpronounceable names, \u2018fun\u2019 menu that might need a manual to open and read, the likes.\n\u2014\nFinally, keep it simple and fun for people to come by to get some food. Don\u2019t let your truck stay still (pun intended). You have the flexibility to change location (with necessary permits and paper works, of course), menu and add other elements to make your business a success."

        "author": "gauravtandon-zomato",
        "content": "As we mentioned in our blog post on \nZomato Infrastructure Services\n, there are three key strengths of Zomato as a business \u2013\nUser penetration and market share\nRich data about our users\nSupplier relationships\nKeeping this in mind, less than six months ago, we started our table reservations business by switching on our \u201cconcierge\u201d based table reservation service in Delhi NCR. We started with the top 1000 most visited restaurants in Delhi, on Zomato.\nIn 30 days, we clocked ~16,500 reservations for restaurants in Delhi, and by our estimates, overtook the largest reservations player in India with zero marketing spends. Gradually, we switched the feature on in a lot more cities, and also started integrating the restaurant\u2019s inventory systems with our reservation systems to provide a more real time experience to our users.\nA couple of months later, we launched our reservations service in Dubai. It took us about half a day to become the largest player in the country by number of reservations in a day. This also prompted Deepinder to send an email to the entire team (#facepalm) \u2013\nI can go on and on about how cool the sheer amount of traffic that Zomato gets is, and what we can do with it. But for now I am focusing on growing the table reservations business, and will talk about just that.\nWhile all this is great, the biggest challenge in growing the table reservations business is that even though we are already the market leaders in both India and UAE, people don\u2019t generally reserve tables in these two countries. And we needed to find ways to grow the business faster. One obvious thought we say no to, time and again is discount led growth. Which means that you offer steep discounts to users to get them to try out your product, and over time hope that these users will become full price customers.\nThis blog post is to educate all of us on the downsides of discounting led strategy. Fortunately, we didn\u2019t have to learn this on our own.\nOne week before the week of Valentine\u2019s day, one of our competitors had launched a multi-million dollar deep discounting marketing campaign (up to a crazy 90% off) to get users to try their product, with hope that the users will stick to the platform. All along the way, we resisted the temptation to follow suit and resort to unsustainable tactics in order to grow and compete. In fact, we got down to the basics and kept chugging along to ensure great user experiences through the Zomato app.\nNow, we also regularly talk to a majority of our restaurant partners to keep track of competitor\u2019s metrics. Here\u2019s what we discovered about our competitor\u2019s booking volume vs ours during the week of deep discounts, and the week after.\nFaith in humanity restored.\nThe writing on the wall is clear \u2013 there\u2019s more to growth than discounts. All that matters is getting the right users/customers to try out your product and keep using it. Not all users/customers are right for your business \u2013 some of them hurt the business. People who prefer deep discounting always need a bait to switch (we have been saying this since the Groupon days, and nobody ever learns).\nIn the meanwhile, we do get an occasional email from a user or two complaining about the lack of deep discounts on Zomato. We only reply with \u201cit\u2019s a feature, not a bug\u201d.\nFootnote \u2013 discounting does work in some cases. For example, when you want to run your competitors out of money. According to us, it just doesn\u2019t work for customer acquisition."

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "There has been a lot of confusion amongst our users, restaurateurs, and the media about our \u201ccloud kitchen\u201d service. \u201cCloud kitchens\u201d is a new phrase which doesn\u2019t yet have a definition and is used for a wide variety of business models.\nWith this note, we are hoping to clarify what we are planning to do, and the underlying business model.\nZomato Infrastructure Services\n is a kitchen infrastructure service where we will work with current restaurant business owners to expand their business to more locations without incurring any fixed cost.\nKey points to note about ZIS\nWhat does \u201cinfrastructure\u201d mean in this context?\nThink of these infrastructure services as delivery only food courts in locations slightly off the premium locations (think much lower rentals, but accessible); we will not have take-out or dine-in at these locations.\nEach location that we create for ZIS will have 4 or more restaurant brands co-located with each other, leading to shared (and thus lower) costs; each restaurant brand will have its own space of roughly 300 sq ft.\nThese restaurants can choose to have owned/shared/outsourced delivery personnel \u2013 thus increasing delivery efficiencies.\nLocations are selected based on Zomato data \u2013 the initial pilots are being conducted in locations where we know that the demand is high, and good quality (highly rated) supply is relatively low. Most of these locations are densely populated mid-income areas in large cities, and second tier cities in India.\nZomato will provide the real estate, build the kitchen and supply all the equipment for these brands to just \u2018walk in\u2019 and start their business in a matter of hours.\nBuild out cost for these kitchens is low \u2013 we have invested time and energy in frugal and durable engineering to make sure that we don\u2019t incur large capex while constructing these kitchens for our partners to use.\nTo acquire cooking equipment, we are using Zomato data to identify restaurants which have recently shut down in the vicinity and are acquiring this (almost new) equipment at a discounted value; having said that, we are only procuring the best quality equipment which meets robust safety standards.\nWhat\u2019s the tech angle?\nThe entire tech stack these kitchens would need is provided by Zomato free of cost to restaurants and is part of the \u201cinfrastructure\u201d services.\nZomato Base (POS), and Zomato Trace (Delivery Dispatching and Routing) are the two key components of the tech that will go into these kitchens.\nWe can assume that these kitchens will be some of the most technically advanced kitchens ever made.\nWe will use our data to help our partner restaurant brands create the right menu, and also have the right pricing in these locations to maximise the probability of success of our partner brands.\nWhich brands will be able to use ZIS?\nZomato will not be cooking food by itself in these kitchens \u2013 unlike what some of the other aggregators are doing, we don\u2019t want to compete with our own customers (restaurateurs).\nOnly renowned and reliable operators will be eligible to use these kitchens (minimum rating on Zomato cutoff will also apply).\nOver time, this will help us help our closest partners to expand to markets outside their core cities of operation. For example, we would love to bring Paradise Biryani to Delhi using Zomato Infrastructure Services.\nRestaurants which use our services do not have a lock in period. They are free to walk out (with one month\u2019s notice period) if this is not working for them. In this case, we will get some other brand in that place.\nOver time, we will allow multiple brands to share the same kitchens. For example, a pizza chain could use a particular kitchen spot during the day, and a burger place could use the same spot at night for late night deliveries.\nFYI \u2013 these brands are not expected to be exclusive to Zomato for delivery. We will let these brands list themselves on any other aggregator platform. In general, any new business by us will not misuse the scale of any of our other businesses. All new businesses are expected to become successful on their own, on the basis of their standalone P&Ls.\nWhat\u2019s in it for our users?\nThat\u2019s the fun and most exciting part. The \u201cfront of the house\u201d in these kitchens will be common. As a user, you will be able to select dishes from multiple brands to build a single food order. So if you want to eat shawarma, and your friends want to eat pizza, that can be done in a single order. How about also including a frappuccino, and an ice cream with your order?\nThis is something that\u2019s very new, and is probably the first time in the world that this is being introduced at scale. We are very excited about how our users will use this power feature which will only be available on Zomato.\nWhat\u2019s the business model?\nThere won\u2019t be any fixed cost for restaurant brands to use Zomato Infrastructure Services. In fact, we will only charge them a nominal percentage of their revenue \u2013 we win only if these brands win. Our ZIS team will act as a key partner for them to make their business successful, and in the process, our business successful. Talk of win-wins \u2013 business doesn\u2019t have to be, and shouldn\u2019t be a win-lose situation.\nRestaurants will pay on top of this nominal fee for any other services that they use \u2013 e.g. Order Lead Generation, Advertising, etc.\nOver time, as we scale this business, our costs of operation should come down further and increase our return on capital.\nWho is leading this at Zomato?\nArvind Dixit \u2013 he was the COO of Wendy\u2019s India in his previous role. He has been working with large scale QSRs for all the 18 years of his work life.\nThe team\u2019s plan is to stay lean and only grow up to a max of 5 people until we have about a 100 locations. A lot of the non-tech work is being outsourced to agencies who know how to handle physical buildouts best.\nWhat can go wrong?\nLike anything, this also carries execution risks. Execution risks are too many to jot down here. But we think we are well prepared, and we will execute well here.\nOK cool. Where\u2019s the first kitchen? And what are the expansion plans?\nThe pilot kitchen is in Dwarka. Starting to cook in the first/second week of March. We won\u2019t have another location for another 2-3 months. There\u2019s a lot to learn from the first one.\nOnce we learn the business model\u2019s nuances, and reasonably know how to bypass Murphy\u2019s law, we will expand to 5 locations very soon. Post that, after one more big iteration of the business model, we will scale in second tier cities. We think we can really help expand the restaurant industry beyond the top 7 metros with ZIS \u2013 and that\u2019s where the real opportunity for ZIS lies.\nOur initial estimates tell us that with some hard work, we can have a 100 locations by the end of 2018. As of now, we are not sure when and how this model will scale to our other strongest countries of presence.\nWhy are we doing this? And what gives us the confidence that we as a company, are well positioned to pull this off?\nThere are three unique advantages that we have as Zomato to be able to pull this off \u2013\nUser penetration \u2013 we can generate demand for these locations through our app traffic, thus minimising the chances of failure for these locations.\nData, tech \u2013 from our app traffic data, we know the most conspicuous locations with a supply/demand mismatch.\nSupplier Relationships \u2013 we are in the good books of most of the restaurant industry \u2013 our relationships with the most prominent restaurant owners give us the leverage to help expand the industry in a good way."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/dealing-with-competition/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "Restaurants are mushrooming everywhere, in every big city and even the tier two cities. Content on Zomato tells us that there were 13,645 active restaurants in 2015 in India and that number grew to 27,614 active ones in 2016. This looks great for the restaurant industry. With so many varied cuisines and kinds of restaurants, cafes and pubs opening across the country, there are more and more people ditching their corporate jobs to follow their restaurant dream. All that is fantastic, but it also means as a restaurateur you have competition. And lots of it.\nIf yours is a successful restaurant, it still doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll sail through effortlessly with all these new restaurants opening up around you. How do you plan to sustain your business without a heavy dip? If you think you don\u2019t need to do anything, in no time you will be overtaken by the new kid on the block and you might have to shut shop. And you don\u2019t want that. There aren\u2019t any fool-proof ways of making sure you stay afloat. But there\u2019s enough space for everyone to coexist in this business.\nCheck them out\nIf you see an opening soon sign of a restaurant in the neighbourhood, be curious. These days with a few clicks it\u2019s easy to find out about a restaurant before it opens. There\u2019s usually some buzz created on social media. Once they open, be sure to drop by for a casual visit. Check their menu out \u2013 dishes, prices, offers and the likes. You should know where to start work on with yours. In any case, if their restaurant is anything remotely similar to yours with regard to cuisine, style and price points, customers are going to get curious and visit them. Don\u2019t make any decisions in haste. Wait it out for a couple of weeks before you make any changes to your service and menu.\nTweaks and changes\nNow that you know what they\u2019re all about, it\u2019s time to make little tweaks to things around your restaurant. Not too much and not too drastic. If it has been way too long since you\u2019ve updated your menu, you might as well do it now. Again, it doesn\u2019t have to be anything major. Even introducing a specials menu works. It\u2019s something new for your customers and also for you to stay relevant in the business. Of course, introducing something new is probably easier compared to changing things entirely. There will be a change in rhythm and it\u2019s a great opportunity for you to test anything new.\nPay attention to customers\nTalk to your customers. Find out what\u2019s working for you, or not. Read reviews of your restaurant on Zomato and respond to diners, happy or otherwise. Mend things and be sure they come back. The one thing that trumps everything at a restaurant is service. If customers feel taken care of and served well, they\u2019re bound to be repeat customers. Train staff to pay attention to diners, right from the minute they enter the restaurant. Service also means you need to involve the kitchen in it. If food doesn\u2019t reach the tables in time, not much will be of help to save you from bad reviews.\nMake some noise\nSocial media is so strong today, it can make or break a business. Your customers are on it and are talking about restaurants. From a banner ad on Zomato to creating and managing Facebook pages, there are many ways to make sure your presence is felt and your restaurant is seen online. If you\u2019re going to make changes and introduce new things at the restaurant don\u2019t forget to advertise about it. Zomato is where your target audience is, and Facebook is like your notice board where announcements are made.\nLive and let live\nLastly, you should welcome some healthy competition. It makes you push for more and innovate within your own space. Don\u2019t let the hunger to defeat your competition make you get nasty. If not them, there will be others who come by and maybe even bigger players than you. Do what you do best and everybody wins. Play your cards right and you might pull out tricks from your sleeve you didn\u2019t even know about. Remember, there\u2019s enough pie for all."

        "content": "As Zomato became the go-to app for foodies around the world last year, we began to see a rise in biased content on our platform \u2013 most of this appeared to come in from various social media agencies. Meanwhile, a lot of users had also taken to writing reviews that weren\u2019t particularly constructive, in a bid to climb the Leaderboards in their respective cities. \u00a0\nAll ratings on our site are governed by user activity, so ensuring that these are generated by fair and neutral user inputs is of paramount importance to us.\nOur first big step towards countering these reviews and ratings was \nProject Warp\n \u2013 a complete overhaul of our ratings algorithm along with a few other essential bias checks being put into place. Here\u2019s the long and short of what we did and how it helped \u2013\nUser credibility scores were updated. This helped us more accurately predict individual \u201cbias\u201d in reviews.\nThe recency of reviews matters a whole lot more now, and prevents restaurant ratings from being drastically affected by very old reviews.\nReviews that have been moderated for policy violations such as abuse or plagiarism automatically carry less weight.\nWe have a detailed blog post, with a full breakdown of how Project Warp works. You can read it \nhere\n.\nToo much of a good thing\nWe originally introduced the concept of Leaderboards to honour our users who shared reviews and photos regularly on Zomato. Some of our users were even writing almost 30 reviews a day! We were super excited about this flurry of activity, but we later found that this healthy \u201cgamification\u201d had resulted in reviews being plagiarised. Not to mention a lot of \u201cfiller\u201d reviews flooding the platform, that weren\u2019t particularly helpful to other users. Even more disconcerting, was the continued trend of users leveraging their position on the Leaderboard to solicit restaurants, something we\u2019ve been fighting since day one. But what hurt us the most was our users telling us that Zomato reviews weren\u2019t particularly helpful when looking for a restaurant.\nReviewing our review system\nWe\u2019re now taking a few steps to combat this. Starting today, our users in India will be able to write a maximum of 10 reviews per month. We know, you\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cThese guys are utterly insane!\u201d but bear with us, and read on:\nThe aim of this new review limit is to help users build credibility on the platform through better content over a period of time, rather than them being able to become influencers practically overnight.\nWe will also be phasing out review and blog Leaderboards. Given that frequency of activity was the key factor behind earning a spot on the Leaderboard, this no longer seems to be appropriate recognition, with the new 10 review limit. Inputs from users and restaurants, who felt the Leaderboard was enabling a lot of spam on Zomato, helped solidify this decision.\nThat being said, we are already in the process of re-imagining and reworking Leaderboards, so that users can be appropriately rewarded for both quantity and quality.\nWhat this means to you as a user\nThe call to introduce this new review limit was a data-informed one. We crunched the numbers thoroughly in order to measure the kind of impact the decision would have on our sizeable India user base.\nAlmost 97% of our users in India will be able to carry on writing reviews as they did before, and won\u2019t be affected by the change at all\nWe do understand that the limit may be a problem for power-users who have been active on Zomato for a few years now. We\u2019d like to ask you to please write to us at \nneutrality@zomato.com\n, if you have any concerns about this change\nWe completely get that this change is hard to take, but ensuring that site remains relevant across the board for our user base, is vital. Zomato\u2019s core mission is helping people identify great places to eat. Reviews form a significant chunk of the decision-making process, and we need to keep doing what we can to safeguard the relevance and usefulness of our content for every foodie out there."

        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "Exactly one week to V-day, as Valentine\u2019s Day is popularly known nowadays. Needless to mention, this\u00a0is one big day for restaurants after Christmas and New Year\u2019s Eve. Big as in, a packed house and massive hustle-bustle. Who wouldn\u2019t want that? We have seen in the past how restaurants have done brilliantly well with their service during Valentine\u2019s Day \u2013 chauffeur-driven limo service with a romantic dinner for two followed by staying the night at the hotel and some not so luxurious but still good for a romantic night out with your partner. It\u2019s a new year and a new Valentine\u2019s Day. If you haven\u2019t planned anything yet at your restaurant, you should right away.\nWhatever you do, though, a few do\u2019s and don\u2019ts are in order. Just a few things to keep in mind so you don\u2019t end up overdoing the celebration of love or not caring enough.\nDo\u2019s:\nOne for two, please\nA great way to have couples get closer at the table is to have sharing plates on the menu. It\u2019s a fun way to serve and have food. Have a special menu for the day and include a few of these sharing plates. From fries to hummus, there\u2019s a range of dishes you could do sharing plates with. Not just food though, you can do one of those community drinks, but for two. Makes drinking a lot more fun. It\u2019s basically one drink\u2013usually a cocktail\u2013in one large goblet kind of a glass, usually shared by groups of four. You could turn it into something romantic and make it one for two.\nYou are on candid camera\nWell, not really. Many couples do post pictures on their social media when they\u2019re at restaurants. More so when they\u2019re celebrating an occasion. And when it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day they have a lot more reasons to play dress up and get their pictures taken. Have your staff be attentive and ask couples if they need any help with taking pictures of them. Even candid ones. Help them make memories they can later relish\u00a0in their pictures.\nDeliver food with\u00a0love\nNot all couples want to head out to restaurants for a Valentine\u2019s Day dinner. Some of them prefer to stay home and cozy up to a romantic movie and dinner. You can sure make it easy for them with a special menu for home deliveries. Valentine\u2019s Day combos with starters, mains and dessert make a great offer for couples to order in on the day. Get cheesy with heart-shaped pizza maybe? Or maybe not. But it\u2019s a great opportunity to offer more to your customers than the usual. Add a couple of roses to their order and you\u2019re sure to have made them smile.\nAll the single folks\nWith all the love in the air, don\u2019t forget the single people. No need to sideline them. Instead let them have fun with some \u201csingle special\u201d dishes. Maybe they\u2019re in a relationship with food. If yours is a pub or a bar, even better. Have some fun drinks and food for single people. Have them come to your pub instead of staying home or going alone to a restaurant. An even better idea would be to cater to groups of singles. Friends would ideally hang out together and what better way to celebrate their love for one another than a night out at your pub?\nGo big or go home\nThere isn\u2019t a lot of time on your hands to plan something really big for your customers. But that shouldn\u2019t stop you from making sure diners walk in through the door for a big Valentine\u2019s Day celebration. You could have a gig at the restaurant \u2013 comedy, music or even a romantic quiz where you can keep things interactive. You could have cookies, chocolates and/or roses as return gifts for customers to win them over if you haven\u2019t already. There\u2019s lots you can do and this is a great opportunity to bring in new diners and old, and show them a great time.\nDon\u2019ts:\nNo tacky day\nDon\u2019t go overboard with restaurant decorations. You don\u2019t want it to look like the Valentine\u2019s Day scene from Sex and the City with balloons and strings all over the dining area. It\u2019s distracting and tacky. You don\u2019t want to end up on social media for the wrong reasons. Valentine\u2019s Day is no excuse for you to recycle old Christmas decorations, neither is it a time for your restaurant to look like it threw up balloon and thermacol hearts in its dining area. Remember, less is more. Minimalistic decor for the day and keeping it classy is key. Candles on the table \u2013 yes. Heart shaped anything on the table \u2013 heck, no.\nDown with the noise\nThis probably applies to restaurants and not pubs and bars. If people want music, they\u2019d go to a bar or pub. The setting there is such that it allows them to have music louder than other eating establishments. At a restaurant, people sit across each other and engage in conversation. More so on Valentine\u2019s Day. You don\u2019t want to spoil that experience with love songs blaring in the restaurant. A great alternative is to have a live gig there with a musician. The next best thing is to have a feel good playlist at reasonable volume.\nGetting over chocolate\nEnough with the chocolate fountains, lava cakes, sinful chocolate cakes and all things only chocolate covered in more chocolate. Yes, it\u2019s delicious. But it\u2019s also a cliche. A bowl of melted chocolate to dip strawberries into and feed each other is very rom-com in nature and many couple would love it. However, have other interesting options that you might not have on your regular menu. It\u2019s a great way to see if people like it. Try various combinations to make it two ingredients belong in that one dessert. Now, that\u2019s romantic. Apple and cinnamon, pear and vanilla, strawberries and chilli, and so many more to experiment with.\n\u2014\nMore than any of these dos and don\u2019ts, remember to make sure your diners have a good time. It\u2019s a special day for many and they love to celebrate it with food and gifts. If anything, your service that day should be top class."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/5-tips-great-customer-service/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "Food critics all over the world have reviewed restaurants on the basis of food and service. The same has extended to user reviews on platforms like \nZomato\n and Facebook. Good food must meet good service, else the dining experience is incomplete and unsatisfactory. Going by such reviews, it\u2019s safe to say that diners would give restaurants a second chance when the food would have been average but service was top quality. But when tables are turned, diners swear off restaurants where their experience with service was terrible and food, great. It boils down to value for money that goes beyond a plate of food.\nService to many \u2013 restaurants and diners \u2013 would immediately mean waiters\u2019 manners and etiquette. Little do they know, from a phone call, online ordering, seating, music and so much more contribute to service. It\u2019s about overall customer experience and all of these factors add to it.\nRight foot forward\nWhat options do diners have before they actually step into your restaurant? Call in to book a table, book a table online or walk in without a reservation. When they call to book a table, the staff answering the phone needs to be attentive, polite and efficient. It has to be a short call, making sure the potential diner on the other end isn\u2019t annoyed with unclear answers and endless list of questions. You don\u2019t want them to not show up once they have spoken to an inefficient staff member on the phone. The same principle applies while taking orders on the phone, if you haven\u2019t already signed up for online ordering services. It is off putting to talk to restaurant staff on the phone going over orders multiple times. It may lead to them canceling their order right there. What\u2019s worse is when you\u2019ve got their order wrong. That\u2019s pretty much the nail on the head for the customer.\nTech it or leave it\nIt\u2019s 2017. If you\u2019re a mid-size restaurant with an average cost for two going upward \u20b9500 and haven\u2019t signed up with Zomato\u2019s \nonline ordering services\n, you\u2019re behind a few years. What\u2019s the service angle, you ask? A customer doesn\u2019t have to keep referring to a menu in hand or the phone (such a pain!), no chance of orders going wrong and more chances of them ordering more. Because when you have the menu online and all they have to do is keep adding items to their order, chances are they\u2019re going to order more than their usual. This is giving them good service where the convenience of ordering in trumps an inconvenient phone call.\nNot just ordering in, convenience comes in various forms. Like, if yours is a cafe, offer WiFi. If it\u2019s a pub, host events like comedy gigs or pub quiz. These are a part of good service because you\u2019re giving them more than just food. And that\u2019s why they\u2019re coming back to you.\nFor better or for worse\nBe prepared. Seems like a no-brainer, but many restaurants even today are not very good with business forecasting. Absorb what\u2019s going on outside of your restaurant and apply it in your business. From festivals to other holidays, people are going to walk in without reservations and expect good service.\n Managing crowds\n during peak season isn\u2019t easy but your diners expect to be comfortably seated and served. If you are anticipating a full house, ensure the kitchen and bar are well stocked. You don\u2019t want to say no to a diner. A seamless service might be a challenge for you, but for your diners it means great service and giving your restaurant great reviews.\nCommunication is key\nSpeaking to diners politely is only the tip of the service iceberg. From reservation phone calls to a goodbye post their meal, and everything in between is important. Don\u2019t keep diners in the dark about their food arriving late or if a dish is unavailable. Give them the option to customize their dishes if you can accommodate it. Don\u2019t have your wait staff on their toes ogling at the diners\u2019 waiting for them to finish their meal so they can swoop in and clear the table. Instead, have patience and let the diners enjoy their meal at their own pace. Observe, but don\u2019t make them uncomfortable. Don\u2019t overdo the \u2018good service\u2019 bit.\nCustomer is always right\nAlright, they are not *always* right. But you have to give them the benefit of the doubt. Always. Don\u2019t disagree with them when there\u2019s a problem. Be it a billing issue or something with a dish, or anything else. Just listen and talk it out. Ideally, you should take them away from the main dining area so other diners aren\u2019t disturbed or given the wrong impression. Arguing with them isn\u2019t going to get you anywhere. If anything, it will make them further more angry. Settle it right there and give them a dessert or drink on the house. Don\u2019t think it\u2019s OK to lose a customer because there are plenty others. One irate customer is enough to get the ball rolling in this day and age of social media.\n\u2014\nIn short, give your customers the kind of service you expect from other businesses. They\u2019re paying for a meal and you give them more than what they signed up for, you\u2019re going to see them more often."

        "content": "You\u2019ve got a big family dinner coming up. How can you be sure that the restaurant you\u2019ve picked out is the perfect place to host it? Why, hop on Zomato of course! There are loads of reviews there to help confirm your impeccable taste in dining establishments. But there are so many things to consider \u2013 is the lighting perfect? Which dish is unmissable? Will they refill your water glass often enough?\nThese struggles are real, and we\u2019ve all faced them at one time or another. We realised that all the information in reviews needed to be packaged and presented in an easier way, to help our users make better and faster choices. And this is where our new\u00a0\nReview Highlights \nfeature\u00a0comes in.\nWhat we\u2019re doing\nIn a nutshell, making your life a whole lot easier \u2013 we\u2019re crystallising all the opinions in a restaurant\u2019s reviews into a single section. One glance will now tell you exactly what people loved there, and what to look out for when you visit, be it stunning rooftop seating or a risotto that\u2019ll knock your socks off. Aggregated ratings (that we like to call \u201csentiment scores\u201d) for food, service, and ambience, will also give you a better idea of how diners feel about each of these decision criteria.\nHow we\u2019re doing this\nBy combining natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and a bit of engineering wizardry. The first step was identifying every relevant verb and noun that we could use, by analysing every review on the platform. Once we had the starting point for our (ever increasing) word bank, it was a small matter of working our magic under the hood, and we were good to go. Allow us to illustrate.\nLet\u2019s use pizza as an example \u2013 because why use anything else? Assume that about 50 people who ate at a particular restaurant had only nice things to say about their pizza (and that the word \u201cbae\u201d was used a LOT). And maybe 4 others didn\u2019t particularly care for how it tasted. We weigh the positive mentions against the negative ones, while also factoring in how often each word was mentioned in the reviews, and boom! \u201cPizza\u201d at that restaurant now has a score.\nWe did this for every keyword, with the highest scoring ones for each restaurant taking pride of place on their Zomato pages. But wait, what about the aggregated sentiment score we spoke about earlier? Pretty much the same as above, but only for all food related words, rather than specific dishes. Rinse and repeat for service and ambience, and the review highlights are good to go.\nSometimes, the ambience or service at a restaurant may not be spoken about enough for it to have a score. So if you happen to see missing categories on the page, don\u2019t worry \u2013 they\u2019ll join the party once people start talking about them. The obvious exception here would be places that only offer takeaway and delivery. The section will be dedicated to highlighting what you need to know about their food and service, as the ambience isn\u2019t relevant.\nEvery year, diners worldwide collectively waste about 15,000 hours trying to figure out what to eat [citation needed]. That lost time is never coming back, and you deserve to be spending it with your loved ones, or doing whatever it is that makes your life awesome. Besides, faster decision-making means you can be eating sooner, and who doesn\u2019t want that?\nThis feature is currently live in India, Australia, New Zealand, UAE, and Malaysia, on iOS and mobile web. But we\u2019ll be spreading the joy to all our markets, as well as other platforms, very soon. Watch this space, and until then, happy eating!"

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/2017-look-like-restaurants/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "It wasn\u2019t very\u00a0long ago when we did a post on \nlast year\u2019s trends\n, and we are already in January 2017. Globally there were several trends that were hits and some misses, of course. Indian restaurants caught a couple of them like including organic food in their menu, going off the regular menu and celebrating seasonal produce and more. If you read about the trends predicted for 2017 globally, Indian restaurants might just keep a safe distance from most of them. We\u2019ll get to that later. Let\u2019s talk about things that began last year and looks like they\u2019re here to stay with us this year too.\nDoing the organic thing\nThe country is getting bigger, not just population-wise (India is very close to toppling China on the list). According to this Times Of India \narticle\n, there are 9.8 million men and 20 million women in India who are overweight. That\u2019s an alarming number. That\u2019s why more and more restaurants are leaning towards \u2018healthy\u2019 menus. Many restaurants are tying up with organic farms to provide for produce. Home delivery outlets like \nRaw Leaf\n and \nSalad Days\n (Delhi NCR based) are branching out to various locations with fresh and healthy food. If you think organic food won\u2019t fit in an Indian menu, check out the menu of \nOrganic Swaad\n in Mumbai. There\u2019s a section of their menu dedicated to organic food combinations. That probably is the ideal way of introducing organic or healthy dishes in your menu. If nothing, it gives customers a choice.\nCelebration of the veggies\nChefs today are experimenting with a ton of vegetables available in their city. Not just the season\u2019s specials, but with vegetables that are either forgotten or simply overlooked and ignored, like the purple carrots, colocasia (arbi), lotus stem and so many more. Be it \nThe Bombay Canteen\n or \nMasque\n (Mumbai), vegetables are sourced locally and cooked beautifully. When chefs themselves believe in the concept \u2018farm to table\u2019, as a restaurateur, your work is reduced. Whichever the cuisine, there are no excuses not to include seasonal vegetables in your menu.\nEverything in a bowl\nHeard of the burrito bowl? Yes, from deconstructing a dish on a large platter, we\u2019re going to put it all in a bowl. Many delivery-only outlets began these bowl meals. \nRaw Leaf\n has the burrito bowl as menti\noned earlier. Everything that goes in a burrito, simply goes into a bowl without the added carbs of the wrap. Same with rice bowls, noodle bowls, salad bowls and the likes. Comfort became key. If you\u2019re already doing home delivery, including such meals may work out great for your customers.\nMillets over rice\nThe minister of agriculture for Karnataka, Krishna Byre Gowda, has been promoting millets and had even conducted a workshop for chefs to create awareness about millets. Even Chef Manu Chandra has been talking about it ever since. For the record, India\u00a0has been growing millets longer than rice. And many healthy food advocators are bringing back the millet. Many restaurants are proudly including millets in their menu. \nVaathsalya Millet Cafe\n in Bangalore, for instance, has a menu filled with the healthiest options that include a range of millet based dishes. So, don\u2019t be afraid of jumping on the millet bandwagon yourself.\nCoffee roasters and cold brews\nThere was a time when coffee and tea was found almost hidden somewhere between fresh lime soda and milkshakes in a corner of a menu that no one read. Today there are coffee shops that roast their own coffee beans and custom make your order. Not every coffee tastes the same and the idea of a truly good cup of freshly brewed coffee right in front of your eyes has seemingly grown on coffee lovers across cities. Be it \nBlue Tokai Coffee Roasters\n in Delhi or \nThird Wave Coffee Roasters\n in Bangalore, you know this is catching on. It hasn\u2019t caught on quite as much as the coffee roasters, but the cold brew coffee is slowly finding a place in people\u2019s smugs. The coffee roasters do have this in their menu but Sleepy Own which is a delivery only concept, has special cold brews delivered right at your doorstep.\n\u2014\nGlobally there have been quite a few trends. The ones that India took notice was the golden latte. Something we chugged down as kids with our eyes tightly shut and breath held till the last drop went down our throats. Haldi doodh is what it was called at home. Everywhere in the world they seemed to have discovered the goodness of turmeric and quite literally put it in every glass of milk. From \nThe Telegraph\n to \nThe Guardian\n, it was everywhere.\nConclusion: Trends do come and go, but if they\u00a0can help bring more customers to your restaurants, why not give it a shot?"

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/restaurant-staff-happy/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "Without a team that has your back, you can\u2019t have half a successful business. In the world of restaurants, you know you need a rock solid team. It\u2019s easy (and lazy) to think that you can churn out people in and out of your restaurant like you do dishes. But you will soon see it all crashing down like a pile of plates that under appreciated waiter carries across the hall.\nIt is also easy to brush off \nstaff retention\n issues as a nagging problem that you won\u2019t deal with and is not your headache. But your restaurant is. The people you hire as your staff are a part of your business family. Why \u2018family\u2019? Else they won\u2019t attach themselves to your restaurants and neither will you to them. You don\u2019t need examples to follow or even a template. Don\u2019t treat them as just someone at your restaurant doing the dishes or taking people\u2019s orders. They should be given the respect they deserve because they are the ones doing the heavy weights for you. There are more than a couple of ways to help you keep your staff motivated and happy.\nCompensate well\nA no-brainer and something you must have heard of over and again. But remember the kind of business you\u2019re in. Staff poaching is so common in the restaurant industry that it won\u2019t be surprising to see most staff members having dozens of restaurants in their resume. If you\u2019re barely compensating them with minimum salaries, you are bound to lose a few of them to other restaurants, even your competition. Even if you start them off with the basics, be sure to re-evaluate their salary after being satisfied with their work. Add some perks and you are golden.\nRespect them\nCompensation can only do so much. If your team doesn\u2019t get the respect they merit, you\u2019re going to get the same treatment. If not directly, they\u2019ll find other ways. The wait staff, for instance, takes care of angry, demanding and arrogant customers for you most of the time. They do everything in their control not to let matters escalate. If they turn around to be treated like furniture by you, they are almost out of there. By respecting them, you\u2019re earning their respect too. You can\u2019t pay for it or either demand for it.\nGive them a break\nRecently, \nThe Bombay Canteen\n shut their dinner service one night just so the entire staff could celebrate the new year together. The management, wait staff, kitchen staff \u2013 everybody were together as one celebrating, drinking, dancing and having a ball. Pictures of this floated all over social media and gave everybody a glimpse of how this restaurant was one big family. Every restaurant should take a leaf out of this example and try some fun things to do together.\nBrainstorm with them\nYes, you are the boss. They know it, everybody knows it. But you won\u2019t be not the boss without a\u00a0staff. They are primarily the ones talking to your customers, cooking them their food and collecting the money. They know the ground realities of a service by being in it. Instead of a boring old staff meeting where you delegate work to them, exchange ideas along with it. They are in the business so one day they make it on their own. Which means most of them are bubbling with ideas they don\u2019t get to execute. Give them a chance and watch them grow. And in turn, watch yourself grow too.\u00a0\nListen to them\nAs mentioned in the earlier point, they know the ground realities better than you. If they\u2019ve faced a problem, you need to know about it. Being a ringmaster having them scared for their life when your shadow appears is not ideal when you want them to open up. Be it a kitchen goof-up or a customer complain, you should know. They can choose to share it with you or not to. You want the former. Develop a healthy and open communication channel for them to come to you first.\nThank them\nIt might seem silly and unnecessary, but just saying a simple thank you every once in a while will makes the trouble they go through day in and day out a little more worth it. Whether or not\u00a0you can afford to give them regular pay raises, thank them unconditionally and appreciate their work. Don\u2019t you want your restaurant to be noticed, loved and appreciated by your patrons? Extend the same to your staff who depends on you for their livelihood."

        "content": "The party is over but the ball hasn\u2019t dropped.\nDecember saw a colourful and vibrant party season with Christmas and New Years\u2019. There was great food everywhere and people couldn\u2019t get enough of it. Restaurants were busier than ever. Tables full, bars full, food flying out of the kitchen \u2013 good times indeed.\nNow that we\u2019ve bid goodbye to 2016, and the new year is still settling in, things are slower. People are going back to work and crawling back into routine. Restaurants will be relatively slow and food won\u2019t be flying off the counters. However, one\u2019s got to eat and people are already looking at eating healthy and light. As a restaurant you will need people to still walk into your establishment. But you can\u2019t lure many of them in with parties and offers that are redundant at this time of the year. Give people what they want and you\u2019ll sail through the month easily.\nCombo meals\nWe\u2019ve spoken about various \nways to increase profit margins with your menu\n by offering combinations of dishes at lowered prices. This is ideal for slow season and when people aren\u2019t frequenting restaurants. You could offer healthier options and guilt-free dishes for people to bounce back to their routines without giving up on delicious food. Early January is when most of them are looking to eat clean and not indulge like they did in December. A soup and salad, soup and sandwich, cold pressed juice with salad and so many various combinations will work for cafes, continental, European, American and even Asian cuisine serving restaurants.\nOnline ordering\nAs mentioned earlier, people frequenting restaurants will be slightly on the lower side this month. Hence, online ordering works great. People in offices are looking for good food and going out isn\u2019t an option for many. Offering good breakfast and lunch options so people can conveniently order online from saves them the trouble of calling restaurants. With online ordering you can go a step further and offer discounts and give customers another chance of ordering from your restaurant. What you can\u2019t make in footfalls you can make in delivery. With Zomato\u2019s services your restaurant is exposed to mostly foodies from all kinds of corporate offices. The direct reach helps you bridge the gap this slow month might create.\nStart afresh\nThis can also be a good time for you to revamp and restructure your menu. \nAn effective menu\n solves half your concerns about margins. Take this time out to restructure your menu if you think it needs it. Declutter, organize and give your customers something new to come back to. Chalk out a plan for the coming quarter with gigs and special food festivals in mind so you don\u2019t need to resort to last minute scrambling like how it usually is in the restaurant business. When you know customers are enquiring about special events or food festivals, you should pounce on it and plan monthly special events. For instance, pick a regional cuisine and talk to your chef about how you can plan a food festival around it with special dishes from the cuisine. If not your chef, you can reach out to other chefs who specialize in that cuisine to be a guest chef at your restaurant. There\u2019s so much you can plan when your restaurant is not booked out.\nBack to the blackboard\nIf you want to experiment with something new this month, a specials menu is perfect. Introduce new dishes and test them out this month with your customers. Email them or call them to come over and try your new specials. It won\u2019t just bring people back to your restaurant, it will also bring a welcome change with the new year. A good start is to talk to your suppliers about what\u2019s new in the market and what\u2019s in seasonal. Whether or not you choose to include it in your menu, it would make for a good new specials addition. If you\u2019re looking to bring families back to your restaurant, buffets are a no-brainer. Families usually gather over lots of food and buffets are an ideal set-up for them. If you\u2019re just introducing the service in your restaurant make sure you know all the \npros and cons of having buffets\n.\nLastly, happy new year!"

That\u2019s right, you can order your New Year\u2019s Eve dinner right now, and it will be delivered to you fresh on the 31st. Here are the steps to a hassle-free year-end celebration.\nPre-ordering will be available from midnight on the 28th, and will be active up to midnight on the 30th. We are partnering with a select few restaurants to make sure your pre-orders are delivered on time.\nIn case you don\u2019t place a pre-order (we all have those \u201clast-minute-impromptu parties\u201d), you can still use the regular Zomato online ordering feature for your last meal of the year. However, given the surge in demand, these last-minute orders have a high chance of taking an unreasonably long time to reach you. It\u2019s also important to note that our online ordering service will go offline at 9:30 PM on the 31st. You\u2019ll still be able to call restaurants to order, but given our experience over the last couple of years, restaurants have a tough time efficiently dealing with orders coming in post 9:30 PM on New Year\u2019s Eve.\nStill not convinced? Here\u2019s a little more motivation for the party planner in you \u2013 most restaurants are offering huge discounts on pre-orders! So help the small business owners (and us) with a bit of prior notice, and we promise to make it an amazing experience for you.\nP.S.

        "content": "It\u2019s the end of the year and business is looks good. People are walking into restaurants now more than they did last month or early this year. Everyone\u2019s in a good mood. They want to spend some good time with their family and friends in their favourite restaurants in town. As a restaurateur, you are on the other side and get to see your restaurant booked out or even people waiting to get in. It\u2019s a great time for all no doubt. But it\u2019s also when you need to take care of and appreciate your customers more than before.\nAppreciation doesn\u2019t need to be vocal or in plain words like \u2018Thank you\u2019. Gestures speak the loudest. Since it is the season for being thankful for everything the year has given, you can include your patrons in the list. Like we always say, little things go a long way. Let\u2019s break down these few \u201clittle things\u201d you can do for your customers this festive season.\nOn the house\nWe\u2019ve previously written about giving a dessert or a beverage on the house in \nhow to handle customer complaints\n. But it doesn\u2019t have to wait till they are disgruntled. Being nice is a part of hospitality. On occasions like Christmas or New Year\u2019s, you can give them a dessert on the house. Even better, send your loyal customers a box of specialties from your restaurant\u2019s kitchen. Cookies, plum cake, cold pressed juices, chocolates, savouries and the likes. With that you can nudge them to visit your restaurant giving them the itinerary for the event. It won\u2019t just get you some good will, but also some buzz in social media.\nSpeaking of social media\nThis is where you need to get on fourth gear. Everybody is looking for new things to do this month. New restaurants to visit, checking out restaurants with special menus or events and posting what they ate where they ate. You have to get some of that action. Regularly post about your restaurant promotions making sure it catches the most eyeballs. A kind gesture will reach a number of potential customers on social media. Haven\u2019t you seen pictures of hampers or even a box of cookies floating around Instagram and Facebook with a thank you note to the brand, restaurant or patisserie? It\u2019s a way to spread the word of your presence and goodness.\nMake them comfortable\nWhen dinners are booked out and people are standing in line, get one of your staff members to attend them. It still isn\u2019t a common practice, but it should be. A negative review begins while standing in line waiting to be served. When someone with a smile helps them stay calm and comfortable, it shows them you care. Even a simple gesture like taking their orders while they wait for a table or having extra stools put up at the bar for them will do more than giving them freebies. Hire extra staff during these peak seasons and motivate your current staff to give the restaurant more than what they normally would.\n\u2014\nSail through this festive season with happy customers on board and you will sure be making merry once the stars are taken down."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/winters-here-whats-cooking/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "Winter has arrived in the country. Alright, not the whole country but you get the idea. Temperatures are dropping and the consumption of whiskey, soup and chai has gone up. Or at least, that\u2019s what we believe. This is the time when dishes like soups and grills are ordered the most. Any feel good comfort dishes are great to have on your menu. It\u2019s also a great time to be using seasonal produce in your dishes. From pumpkin to strawberries, there\u2019s no dearth of recipes you can include in your winter specials menu.\nBe it a slight nip in the air in Bangalore and Hyderabad or freezing your backside cold in Delhi, food is what comforts everyone. Most people don\u2019t want to spend time in the kitchen cooking batches of soups or even roasting their favourite meats. They look forward to restaurants giving them the same. Let\u2019s look at a few things you can do this winter at your restaurant without having to break the bank or take too much effort.\nSpecials menu\nTake out the old blackboard and get writing. Regardless of the cuisines you\u2019re serving at your restaurant, a \nspecials menu\n blends perfectly well. For instance, an Italian restaurant can serve a roast pumpkin risotto, an Indian restaurant can do a beetroot shorba and a cafe can serve banana pumpkin pancakes and hot chocolate for breakfast. A specials menu will bring customers in to try out something new at your restaurant. It\u2019s also a good time for your chefs to get creative.\nSpecial events\nIt\u2019s the end of the year and it\u2019s when people are more relaxed and are in a \u2018jolly\u2019 mood. With Christmas and New Year\u2019s right around the corner, diners are going to head out to have a good time. For Christmas, you can do a set menu or a spread of Christmas special dishes in buffet style. Even including a roast chicken dish for the day will be enough to draw a few people in. And of course, dessert is a must. Puddings, plum cakes and pies are most popular during winters. For New Year\u2019s, you can have a couples special night with music and special food. Everyone\u2019s looking to go out on New Year\u2019s eve. This will be a good opportunity for you to get them into your restaurant. We are still in festive mode and this is when you should be \nmaking the most out of it\n.\nPromotions galore\nIf you aren\u2019t planning on doing Christmas and New Year specials in particular, you could simply do a winter special food festival through the month or for a week. Winter special dishes from around the globe can be a part of your special menu. Most five star hotels indulge their patrons with lavish spreads of such food. There\u2019s no reason a stand alone establishment can\u2019t do the same. Even if not as lavish. Promote it on social media and you\u2019ll spread the word around. You don\u2019t want your competition and every other restaurant doing something different and fun during this season while you stick to routine serving the same food.\nEntertainment factor\nThis is a great season to have comedy gigs and live music going at your restaurant or cafe. Even bars and pubs have been hosting such events so their customers are entertained and engaged. Just serving good food isn\u2019t enough any more. You need to go the extra mile to win over your customers. Hire local comics or musicians for gigs during weekends at your restaurant this month and see how tables get full. If it\u2019s feasible, even have an entry charge for the same. It\u2019s a win-win for everyone.\nLights and action\nSpeaking of Christmas and New Year\u2019s, there\u2019s one more thing to keep the festive spirits high. Decor. Homes across the country are lit and decorated during this time, why should restaurants be left behind. Tastefully decorated interiors add to the festivities. From twinkle lights to a full blown Christmas tree, you can go little or all out during this time. Music is a part of the ambiance as well. Don\u2019t be too tacky by playing Christmas carols really loud. No one wants that. Instead, get a playlist with some great Christmas specials on it. Ditto for New Year\u2019s eve."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/dishes-cafe-menu/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "If you are relatively new in the business and aren\u2019t entirely sure about most aspects of setting up a restaurant or a cafe, \nstart small with a small budget\n. Let\u2019s now assume yours is a cafe style establishment. If you have a certain cuisine in mind, go with it. If you aren\u2019t quite sure about what the menu should be like, a few pointers could help you. There are some classic dishes you must have in your menu so you attract a wider section of customers. Don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t be set in stone. There\u2019s always time to add or \nrevise your menu\n.\nLet\u2019s have a look at some of the dishes and styles of food your cafe menu should have.\nCoffee\nYes, it seems like a no-brainer. \nBut there are many cafes that are stuck with hot coffee, cold coffee and black coffee. You must evolve with time and trends. You don\u2019t need to turn into a Starbucks, but you don\u2019t have to drive your customers away with the lack of options on your menu for coffee either. If you can serve hot and iced coffee, you can pretty much extend the coffee section by adding at least another 6 or 7 options. Just brush through other cafes\u2019 coffee sections. Get a few bottled flavours like caramel, hazelnut, mocha, vanilla, so on, and just run a few strands of them on a cappuccino with some whipped cream. Now you have a section that can gives you a wider margin of profit just with a few beverages. While we\u2019re at it, if yours is a cafe and you don\u2019t have a good coffee machine, invest in one.\nBreads\nThere are many people who describe the bread served in a restaurant in there reviews. You can tell it\u2019s important for your reputation. Good bread makes an average sandwich a really good one. It\u2019s relatively forgivable if the filling is just passable, but not the buns. For the love of food, don\u2019t go with the cheapest bread in the market or what your vendor is trying to push to you. Try out a few and get yourself some good bread even if it costs a few pennies more. As a cafe, your sandwiches will be one of the most frequently ordered dishes. If your bread isn\u2019t up to mark, it\u2019s going to be downhill from there.\nPizza\nPizza has grown to becomes heavily popular in cafes of late. It isn\u2019t just thick bread like crust topped with a ridiculous number of toppings that clearly don\u2019t belong together on one disc of dough. It also isn\u2019t something that is only associated with ordering in. From the fancy upscale Italian restaurant, the pizza has travelled to the humble everyday cafes. The thin-crust ones with good tomato sauce, some chicken or veggies and cheese melted on top is a popular go-to dish for many cafe goers today. Pizza bases can be easily made in bulk and par baked. Once orders start pouring\u00a0in, just add sauce and toppings, and off it goes into the oven.\nEggs\nMost non-vegetarians love eggs. The best things about eggs is that it is so versatile. They would be a hit even when made for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Heck, there are restaurants that serve ONLY egg dishes. Moreover, many people in cities opt to go out for breakfast during weekends. It\u2019s a great way to bring them into your cafe when you have a variety of egg dishes. From omelettes to poached eggs, scrambled to fried \u2013 there\u2019s no dearth of ways to cook eggs for a meal. It\u2019s fast, easy and almost always a winner with customers.\nDessert\nNo, just a dry old cake from yesterday won\u2019t work. If you can\u2019t afford a pastry chef, get local home bakers to sell you some of their baked goodies. Brownies, banana bread, apple pie and a good old fashioned chocolate cake is also a good place to start with desserts. A scoop of ice cream on the side and a drizzle of chocolate sauce works with almost every dessert so you can make it special. Mixed nuts, chocolate and caramel sauce, vanilla ice cream and icing sugar to dust \u2013 all the fixings you need to up your dessert game.\n\u2014\nUltimately, it\u2019s your cafe and you decide what goes up on the menu. A few dishes like the ones mentioned above are only a starting point to give you direction. This has worked for most successful cafe style establishments and are pretty much sure shot winners. One thing\u2019s for sure, doing a little goes a long way, like dusting the banana bread with icing sugar or giving a mini cookie with coffee. When a customer smiles just looking at the food you serve, you know you\u2019ve won more than half their heart."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/update-restaurant-menu/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "Unless you are \nBrahmin\u2019s Coffee Bar\n in Bangalore or \nAl Ustad\n\u00a0in Dubai, or any other legendary restaurant that has been around for several decades, you need to update your restaurant\u2019s menu every couple of years. When do you do it? How do you go about it? So many more questions you need to ask yourself. Once your restaurant catches rhythm in the market and has gained momentum in the first 6 months or even a year of opening, revise your accounts and see which dishes are the money makers and which ones are dead weight on your menu. This is just one of basics.\nChanging your menu means you\u2019re keeping up with time, revisiting what might have been mistakes, clearing clutter and finding ways to improve business and having your customers come back for more. Obviously, starting off right by \ngetting the menu done effectively\n is a great base for you to work on. Furthermore, revising a menu is also a way to \nincrease profit margins\n.\nKeeping up with trends\nFood has sure become fashionable, of late. From the freakshakes to the salads in jars, there\u2019s nothing that restaurants don\u2019t try out at least once. When it comes to following trends, it\u2019s best to have a special menu or special dishes running for a limited period of time. From television to social media, there are a number of outlets that talk about food today. You really can\u2019t miss these trends floating on your timeline everywhere. If a particular trend seems like a fit for your restaurant, test it out by keep it around for a short time. Going by customers\u2019 response you can make it a regular or discard it all together. This gives people a reason to walk into your establishment as well as one for you to work out better margins with whatever is trending at the time.\nCleaning up the dishes\nWhen you can\u2019t make up your mind, you end up putting everything on the menu. It really doesn\u2019t work for customers though. There are way too many multi-cuisine restaurants with a plethora of dishes under each category and cuisine they are serving. 200 dishes on a menu is daunting enough for diners to go through, let alone making a decision. This is when keeping track of the hits and misses pays back. By letting go of dishes that don\u2019t work and have barely been ordered, you\u2019re keeping the menu clutter free and easy on the eyes.\nPricing is key\nRevision of menu includes revision of prices and not just the dishes. Sometimes restaurants change only the prices. With inflation, prices of produce, ingredients and fuel go up. Obviously, you cannot increase prices every time there\u2019s a hike in an ingredient or fuel for instance. Ideally, when there\u2019s a spike in operating costs it should take you 6 to 9 months to implement the new prices. If you hike your prices every few months, you\u2019re going to drive every customer out.\nCheck out your neighbours\nIf a year has gone by without any changes at your restaurant, including the menu, drop by at your neighbouring restaurants to see what the market scene is like. You don\u2019t want to be left behind now, do you? If they have introduced a prix fixe menu, diners have something to look forward to. Time for you to pull up your socks too. Keeping yourself up to date also means keeping a keen eye on the happenings in your neighbourhood restaurants. From restaurant promotions and menu changes to what\u2019s trending and what\u2019s out, you have to be on top of your game."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/thanksgiving-restaurant/",
        "author": "Shakti Shetty",
        "content": "The Indian restaurant scene has evolved a lot over\u00a0the past few years. Also, restaurant-goers have increased and so have the number of restaurants. It\u2019s a chicken eat chicken world out there (you get the idea). Like any other industry and business, the restaurant kind is\u00a0competitive. Fiercely, if I may add. Restaurants are doing anything and everything to stay relevant and beat competition, even if by a hairline margin.\nOne of the tried and tested ideas has been \nrestaurant promotions\n. Loyal patrons get something new to look forward to and the ones who haven\u2019t paid a visit yet get their attention drawn to your restaurant. From food festivals to stand up gigs \u2013 restaurants have opened up various ideas to promote their restaurant and \nmake the most of festive seasons\n. Festive seasons don\u2019t only mean our Indian festivals, but also ones that pop culture has introduced to us. One such would be Thanksgiving. Granted not everyone\u00a0know what Thanksgiving is all about, but it doesn\u2019t stop food lovers from trying out a Thanksgiving special dinner like a roast turkey at their favourite restaurant.\nBesides the obvious that your restaurant gets to break away from the usual menu and have something special for customers, you also get to warm up for Christmas and New Year\u2019s Eve. Let\u2019s look at some of the options for you to look at if you\u2019re planning to\u00a0introduce a Thanksgiving special next week.\nPi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance\nIf you\u2019re doing a promotion at the time, go all out. Get the turkey and give people what they\u2019re expecting. If it\u2019s turning out to be of huge cost, change the style of serving. You can have a few turkeys under a spotlight at the restaurant and have one staff member carve out pieces on to customers\u2019 plates. Not every table or customer needs a whole turkey. A turkey is sure to draw in customers because of the novelty factor.\nAll they can eat\nAnother option is a buffet. Everybody loves a good buffet these days. A special occasion calls for special and more food on the plate. Keep your a la carte menu but have a special buffet for the day. Include a set of new dishes or revamp the ones in your menu. Have a variety of desserts and you\u2019re set for Thanksgiving. Special days like these are when people go out with their families and take a break from home food. Buffets are best suited for large groups and you must\u00a0cash in on it.\nPrix fixe menu\nIn case you don\u2019t have the space or inclination for a buffet, you could do a prix fixe menu. In other words, set menu. It\u2019s special yet not heavy on the operational front. Something simple like roast turkey breast, a salad or soup and dessert will also do. The idea is to break from the routine and give something new to your customers for increase in walk-ins, a spike in business and filling those tables.\nNo turkey, please\nNot everybody would be open to the idea of turkey. A roast chicken however, is something most meat lovers won\u2019t say no to. It can still be a Thanksgiving special dinner, but with roast chicken. If you have all the sides that go with the Thanksgiving theme like cranberry sauce, sweet potato mash or a casserole and pumpkin pie, of course!\nNot just dinner\nIf yours is a bar or a pub, have a cocktail special night on Thanksgiving. Why should coffee get all the pumpkin spice? Flavours like roast pumpkin, cinnamon and gingerbread are going to stand out and be a hit. Sure, Thanksgiving is about family style dinner and the roast turkey. But as restaurant you need to think beyond that. If you have the space for it and if you think it\u2019d work, hire a band to play some good music that night. A little entertainment wouldn\u2019t hurt while families are at the tables enjoying their Thanksgiving meal. If not music, you can also have a stand up comedian put up a show.\n\u2014\nWith Thanksgiving less than a week away, get to work and get that turkey roasting. Send out emailers to your customers and be sure to make some noise on social media. After all, you need to spread the word for people to drop by for a lovely Thanksgiving meal."

Zeroing on the menu, ambiance and the general concept sure must be a thrill. Although, in haste many restaurant jump the gun and wind up with a concept, menu or even ambiance that don\u2019t eventually work well for them. Not to forget, concept must be made keeping in mind a lot of factors. So, first thing first, what is a concept? When someone says, \u201cLet\u2019s go to ABC restaurant, they have awesome burgers and I love the quirky set up\u201d, they\u2019re talking about the concept right there. It\u2019s a quirky casual dining restaurant serving American food.\nYou want your restaurant to work, to become a hit in the neighbourhood and even in the city. You might have the basics right by now \u2013 fine dining or casual, cuisine to be served, nightlife or dine in. There are other questions you need to ask yourself.

Food for instance \u2013 don\u2019t wait to hire your head chef till the last minute and tell him what to cook. Get the important members in your team on board at the early stages. With the chef beside you, you can finalize the dishes and go ahead with the ambiance set up. When you know what cuisine you want to serve, you then need to serve the right dishes. If your restaurant is located near corporate office parks, you should\u00a0know that there will be business meetings at your restaurant. You then need to structure your menu and pricing accordingly.\nTarget audience\nWhat are the kinds of people who might walk into your restaurant? Who are you targeting? Corporate folks, college students, local residents \u2013 know your audience. An upscale fine dine restaurant in a local shopping area where people\u2019s spending capacity is approximately \u20b91000 to \u20b93000 (in India, for instance) is probably cutting it close. But if it\u2019s an all day casual style restaurant serving multi cuisine food with a relaxed ambiance, you might have a winner. Knowing who your potential customers are can shape your concept entirely.\nHomework first\nOf course, all of this renders pointless if you don\u2019t do your research well. Homework in this context simply means to talk to more people in the business. Talk to all kinds of restaurateurs and even the folks around your restaurant\u2019s location. You will at least learn the kind of people that frequent restaurants. Moreover, do your research on the food trends \u2013 what\u2019s hot, what\u2019s not. No, this doesn\u2019t mean you go with what\u2019s current at the time. It means you will have an idea of what people expect. Something like how freakshakes have become\u00a0a trend today. Many cafes have simply included it in their specials menu. When the trend fades, it can go too. A trend will help amplify the concept. Like the freakshakes do to cafes. It suddenly becomes the \u2018it\u2019 place for youngsters to go to.\n\u2014\nThere used to be a restaurant with an \u2018opening soon\u2019 sign put up in Bangalore for months on end. It was to be a Lebanese restaurant. In a drastic turn of events, it suddenly was to be a coastal themed restaurant. Strange, right? Well, that\u2019s restaurant business for you. Things don\u2019t always turn out according to the blueprint. As it turns out, they couldn\u2019t find a good Lebanese chef which led to the change in theme. However, the restaurant didn\u2019t see the light of day. The biggest takeaway from this is you have to learn everything you can about the market, the audience, location and even the food you want to serve. You\u2019d think it\u2019s a given. But going by instances and incidents restaurateurs share, it doesn\u2019t look like many of them just starting off in the industry are thinking it through."

        "title": "Pros And Cons Of Having Buffet Service At Your Restaurant",
        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/pros-cons-buffet-restaurants/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "Buffets have gained incredible popularity in India over the\u00a0past few years. After the corporate boom in cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad and Delhi NCR, restaurants cashed in on the buffet style of meal by offering corporate discounts. Next thing you know, the frequency of families dining out shot up and buffets seem to be the popular choice. As a diner, buffets are inviting because of the variety of food available on a spread. All of that variety comes at a reasonable cost for them. Also, it helps people in a group who want to eat different things.\nThis style of dining has come a long way from only Indian restaurants serving buffets. Now, every other Chinese restaurant offers buffets to their customers. Five star hotels are known to have impressive spreads of buffets to attract more and more diners. People see value for their money in buffets and for restaurants it means much more. Like any other idea, this one too has its pros and cons.\nThe good parts\nVariety\nAs mentioned earlier, customers opt for buffets predominantly for the variety they get for the money they pay. If they were to order every dish they wanted from the menu it\u2019d cost them a lot more. As a restaurant, you have advantage over the no buffet restaurants. Since large groups and families prefer buffets these days, it works out great for you. You can rotate dishes as you like according to your inventory and keep customers happy with new dishes every now and then. It also is a great base for marketing your restaurant whenever there\u2019s something special on the menu for buffet especially during festivals and other holidays.\nSave on cost\nWith buffets you won\u2019t have to have most of your staff taking orders and serving your customers. Since the diners have to get their food themselves, you only need a few of your people to monitor the service to check for refills, whether a diner needs anything, just observing how everything goes and such. Buffets are a great way to use up inventory in the kitchen in bulk so you can restock. You also save time and staff effort by skipping the serving dishes since diners hit the buffet directly with plates.\nLow fuss\nTo an extent, yes. Customers know what they\u2019re getting and can\u2019t customize the dishes as per their taste. This helps in relatively smooth flow of operations and your staff can be slightly more relaxed during these services. Diners only expect a wide variety of food for them to choose from and make their own tasting menu of sorts and won\u2019t take any of the staff\u2019s time to alter their food. The food needs to be cooked in massive portions and then laid out in time for lunch or dinner. Get your prep right and it\u2019s going to be a easy service. When diners have a good time at buffets they tend to come back because it becomes a family ritual of sorts.\nThe not-so-good parts\nWastage\nGetting your chefs to cook all that food and to see it go waste will not only make your heart bleed but also your bank account. The thing about buffets is that, you need to keep the spread of dishes full to draw diners further to them. But it\u2019s never a sure shot thing to work. It\u2019s extremely unpredictable whether or not people will flock to your restaurant on any given day. Instead of families and large groups as you\u2019d like, if single or just a couple of tables are filled the wastage of food sure pinches your pocket.\nStaff alert\nYes, you won\u2019t need as many people on the floor as mentioned earlier. But the ones who do end up looking after the buffet service have a tough afternoon or night. Not just refilling the dishes, but also maintaining hygiene standards, attending children who are a part of the large family groups and making sure everything runs smooth. In the kitchen cooks are constantly ensuring food is prepared on time and there\u2019s enough to refill. Live station counters chefs have to keep dishing out fresh food as and when diners appear.\nReputation matters\nMany restaurants take years to build their reputation. All it takes is one bad experience for a customer to nullify the good ol\u2019 past. Be sure to maintain every check required to put out food in large quantities. Hygiene being the most important one. You don\u2019t want \nwhat happened to a few restaurants\n happen to yours as well. Working with huge quantities of ingredients and other supplies can lead to negligence and carelessness. The owner or manager of the restaurant should monitor each process meticulously to avoid any incident during service.\n\u2014\nNot just a regular all you can eat buffet, you can also introduce sit down buffets where the meal is fixed and will be served at the table. This is one way to control portions to avoid wastage. Most restaurants in five star hotels and some of the up scale stand alone restaurants have the concept of pre fixed menus. A 3-course meal with a beverage. This works great for a corporate lunch. People don\u2019t need to even think about what to order or eat. It\u2019s already decided and all they need to do it show up at the restaurant. These are the alternatives to a standard buffet if you want to change things around a little at your restaurant."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/make-food-more-photogenic/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "Let\u2019s face it. When it comes to visual treats, Instagram and Zomato have grown to become one of the most effective marketing tools for almost every product there is. But food takes the cake (pun intended, of course). From ice cream cones to the humble dosa, every dish is up there on Zomato and Instagram. People have been Instagramming food pictures to the extent that many restaurants\u2019 staff have to wait till the dishes are snapped before laying out the next dish. Foodies have taken their presence on these platforms very seriously. With the kind of following they have on social media, they\u2019re bound to build their feed with the prettiest looking food pictures. From the right angle to the right filter, they have managed to make food look incredibly beautiful to their followers.\nTo go with the current trend, many restaurants and nightlife establishments are slowly making sure their food is photogenic. Why? Because the better it looks on a plate, the more likely customers are going to snap a picture and put it up on platforms like Zomato and Instagram. And that\u2019s not it, they will caption it with the name of the dish and the restaurant. That in turn is read by hundreds or thousands of their followers. If this isn\u2019t a great opportunity for you to get some free marketing, nothing else would be. All you need to do is make your food look more appealing without altering its taste and quality. And that\u2019s the easiest thing to do!\nAccessories\nYou see how Social Offline across cities has gained a large following on Instagram? Look at their pictures and pictures that their diners post. Their fun and quirky accessories like plates, mugs, glasses and the likes have become very popular on social media. Adding some quirk on your customers\u2019 tables gives your restaurant a chance to be unique and stand out. Many pubs caught up soon enough and today have coasters with funny one liners that get snapped by patrons (and sometimes taken home as a souvenir). Paper napkins, beer glasses, coffee mugs, serving plates and so many more things that you can make photo friendly. If it\u2019s just your brand\u2019s name on these things, it won\u2019t be enough for anyone to share it online. Something quirky to go with and you have a winner.\nFood\nOf course, the most important bit is the food. It is said that Indian food is not very photogenic. Turn that around with a few simple tricks. A dish like baingan bharta will pop on a blue ceramic dish and with a garnish of coriander. Something like a pasta alfredo will look a lot more appealing in a dark coloured pasta bowl. Burger on a wooden plank, French fries in a cone shaped container and a stand to hold it are very cool ideas that more and more pubs are considering. There are so many fun ideas on the internet that can help you with plating and other cool quirks. You can add them to your food styling and make the food look better and by extension having more pictures of it taken.\nLighting\nEverything looks great \u2013 food, accessories and styling. But what\u2019s the point of them all if there\u2019s no good light to capture it. Even if yours is a pub, get some light on the tables. There are some fantastic grunge style light fixtures to table lamps that you can get for your place. It not only adds to the overall ambiance but will also be functional providing ample light for food pictures. If your windows are covered up, open them up. Let natural light fill your restaurant during the day. The restaurant looks good. The food served at the tables look good. Pictures look good.\n\u2014\nObviously, all of this is works if your restaurant has room for it. If yours is a fully air conditioned place you can\u2019t open up all the windows, if yours is a QSR style one you can\u2019t walk in the next day and change everything just to make it on Zomato\u2019s and Instagram\u2019s photo feed and if your pub\u2019s lighting is designed to be dim, you don\u2019t want to change that. Introduce little changes that won\u2019t affect your restaurant\u2019s theme or set up largely and hopefully, your restaurant\u2019s pictures make it to all social media platforms."

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "Today marks 4 years of our international presence\n. On the 1st of September in 2012, we launched our very first market outside of India \u2013 Dubai.\nFour years on, we claim to be the #1 player in our space in 18 countries (of the 23 we\u2019re in) in terms of monthly unique users. We say \u2018claim\u2019 because it\u2019s hard to substantiate, given the limited availability of data about our competitors in these countries.\nGiven the data we do have access to, this post is a reflection on how our international foray has worked for us, and where we\u2019re headed as a global consumer internet brand born in India.\nTo start with, here\u2019s some data on some of our cities for you to binge on \u2013\nWhat\u2019s our biggest learning after all these years of running a multi-country business, you ask?\nIt is that everybody should find their own way to determine the real market size for their business. Nobody knows your business as well as you do, so don\u2019t believe the press, the VCs, or market research companies. Listen to everyone, but then decide for yourself.\nWhy do we say that?\nWe often get asked \u2013 \u201cAuckland? Seriously? Isn\u2019t the market size too small?\u201d\nSince we\u2019re on the topic \u2013 we love Auckland. Not just for the\npeople and the city, but also for the market size. Before we go into\ndetail on how the market sizes of our various cities stack up against\neach other, here are some definitions you need to know:\nMarket Size = # of listings in the city x average size of a restaurant x utilisation rates x average ticket size of a meal \nIndexed Market Size:\n Assuming the average size of a restaurant in a city and utilisation rates are the same across the world (and they are, more or less), the relative market size can be defined simply as \n# of listings in a city x average ticket size of a meal\nWe measure \nRelative Market Size\n using Delhi NCR as the benchmark\n(where Delhi NCR = 1). Why Delhi NCR? It\u2019s where we have the richest and\nmost complete restaurant information, making it a fair yardstick for us\nto compare other cities and their importance as a market.\nNow, here\u2019s how the cities we saw in the infographic compare to one another in terms of relative market size. The Strong/Medium labels indicate how we view our position in that market, in terms of a multitude of factors \u2013 including, but not limited to \u2013 our user base, client penetration, revenue, brand recall, and competition.\nSo you see, despite being physically smaller (you can fit ~42 Aucklands into one Delhi NCR), and having fewer restaurant listings (~6k vs ~16k), Auckland is actually stronger than Delhi NCR in terms of market size.\nDoes loving Auckland as much as we do make more sense now? \ud83d\ude42\n\u2013\nThe road ahead\nOver the coming months, we\u2019ll be focusing on 21 cities across these countries, improving our presence and position in newer markets like Kuala Lumpur (where we still consider our position of strength to be comparatively \u2018Low\u2019), and high-potential markets where we\u2019re yet to move into a position of strength, such as Sydney and Istanbul. A lot of this will be driven by operational improvements on the ground, backed by laser focus on our consumer and business products.\u00a0\nFor those wondering \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll look at establishing\nourselves in markets like the UK and the Americas using the same\napproaches we\u2019ve taken in the past. These call for a slightly different\nstrategy, and can only realistically be solved for with very strong and\nsmart tech. There\u2019s a lot of that in the pipeline, so watch this space.\n\u2013\nLooking back, are we glad we decided to take the leap and go international when we did? Certainly. Has it been a roller coaster ride? We\u2019d be lying if we said it hasn\u2019t. Have we learned a lot from it? Way more than we would have learned from sitting in India, reading the Expansion 101 manual.\nMost importantly, though \u2013 has it worked?\nGiven that we\u2019re traffic leaders in all our 21 focus cities and are already delivering USD 3bn worth of value to restaurants \u2013 we\u2019ll dare say it has.\nP.S. The data in the infographic is sometimes from various\nunreliable sources; we have made an effort to be borderline\npessimistic/realistic. Please consider these numbers as guesstimates."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/busy-restaurant-diwali-season-tips/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "This time of the year is the busiest for everyone. People are busy making sweets, shopping and celebrating. Restaurants are packed with customers in celebratory mood. Service is in full swing and this is when you need to don the role of captain of the ship. The busiest season also means room for errors. Without a tight plan you won\u2019t have a cracker of a season. From the menu to your staff, everything needs to be in place. If you want to be a part of the celebrations and \nmake the most of festive season\n, get into planning mode right now.\nStock up\nFrom corporate lunches to family dinners, this Diwali you will see your restaurant bookings spike. If you have experienced a similar season last year, don\u2019t forget to revisit sales and inventory data. Stock up on your supplies well in advance to get the most and the best from your vendors. If you have a special menu for the season, you have more reason to do so. Customers don\u2019t like to be denied a dish you have advertised about and couldn\u2019t serve because you weren\u2019t prepared for it. Nothing like a scorned customer, especially on Diwali. Stock up adequately on ingredients and produce, and have the everyone in your staff contribute to the prep work needed at the time.\nCommunicating with customers\nFor a successful run this season you not only need to ensure every aspect of the restaurant is like a well oiled machine, but also need the cooperation of your customers. Of course, you can\u2019t downright ask them for it. But a few words to encourage them to order sooner will ensure most tables are not only full but can refilled with more diners. Don\u2019t forget to be nice about it. If you have diners waiting to be seated, make sure they have at least one staff member to greet diners and provide them with updates and menus. Nobody wants to keep checking on their table every 5 minutes with the manager. Prompt updates from the staff will keep the diners calm.\nIn a situation where\u00a0you\u2019re expecting large crowds, plan ahead and make more room at the bar for people to wait. In case\u00a0you don\u2019t have a bar, create a space for them to be seated. Hopefully everything goes delightfully smooth, but if\u00a0something goes wrong, stay calm and \ndeal with the situation with patience\n. Take the high road and be the bigger person, regardless of whose fault it is. It\u2019s best to keep the ball rolling instead of stopping to pass it on to customer.\nTalk to your team\nThere have been instances when the staff (particularly the ones answering phones) don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything different or special the restaurant is going to for a particular season or festival. When that happens, you lose a potential customer immediately. People start making enquiries and pay more attention to what restaurants are doing during festivals and holidays. They\u2019re looking for special treats and there isn\u2019t a dearth of them in any big city these days. You have to let your staff in on every promotion happening at the restaurant at least a week in advance. They are the face (or voice) of your restaurant. If they won\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, how will your customers?\n\u2014\nFirst of all, if you aren\u2019t planning on doing anything special at your restaurant this Diwali, you should. Even if it\u2019s not something for dine in customers, you can do something different for delivery service. There will be a sizable number of people ordering in while they play host. From kababs and biryani to pizza, from mithai to brownies \u2013 you have a wide range of food to play around with. And lastly, don\u2019t forget to share your success with your staff by being generous with their Diwali bonus/gifts/tips."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/handle-customer-complaints/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "Let\u2019s face it, you can\u2019t make everyone happy all the time. Particularly when you are in the business of food. As a restaurateur you should know this by now. Before the internet age, customers rarely complained. Or at least it seemed like that. If they weren\u2019t happy about a dish or service at a restaurant, they would simply stop going there. But now with social media, it\u2019s hard not to see complaints and feedback \u2013 be it on Zomato, Facebook or on Twitter. What you do about the feedback is one thing, but what you need to and must do, without fail, is \nacknowledge the feedback\n \u2013 positive or negative.\nAny paying customer expects and rightly deserves value for their money. Whether it is the product itself or service, everybody looks forward to a great experience. And anything can trigger a negative experience for a diner \u2013 a rude waiter, bland food, having to wait too long for a table, unavailability of certain dishes, misinformation, so on. Of course, there are cases when the customer is wrong. Despite them being on the wrong, you should be tactful yet to hold your own.\nFirst things first\nAcknowledging a written or verbal feedback is the first thing you or your management should do. As soon as you acknowledge the complaint, you basically tell the customer that you take them seriously and are ready to fix the problem. Don\u2019t ignore or just brush it under the rug. If you do, you\u2019re aggravating the problem further. Time is a key component here. And you are more likely to lose that customer. As someone in the restaurant business you would know that every customer counts. Once you acknowledge the customer\u2019s feedback, apologize and get the root of it. Fix it and let them know that you have fixed it. This may not calm the customer down right away, but it improves the chances of them returning to your restaurant. And that\u2019s more than what you can ask for.\u00a0\nBe nice\nIn any business, service is everything. More so in the hospitality sector. You\u2019re interacting with the customer directly as opposed to offering them a service remotely. You gather reactions on a real-time basis and have every opportunity to mend any damage done. But before you get to the fixing of the problem bit, don\u2019t forget to be nice. Being polite and gracious will take you farther than roughing them up just because you think you\u2019re right. Being right doesn\u2019t give you the excuse to rub it on the customer\u2019s face anyway. You need them and you need to break it down to them about what went wrong. Like the saying goes, \u201cYou catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.\u201d Don\u2019t let pride come in the way of you winning your customer back.\nMake it up to them\nAfter acknowledging the customer\u2019s feedback and fixing the problem, you could go a step further and make it up to them. There are many ways to do it. For instance, give them dessert or a drink on the house. It\u2019s a small yet effective way of winning your customer back. If you have an upcoming event, make sure they\u2019re invited. You also give them a discount on their next meal. By making it up to them you not only move on from the reason why they were unhappy to putting a smile on their face. In a rare instance that they aren\u2019t convinced or decide not to come back, let it go. There\u2019s only so much you can do.\n\u2014\nEvery scorned customer wants to be heard. They want the issue to be sorted and to be acknowledge by the restaurant\u2019s management. Just by acknowledging them and fixing their problem will help you win them back. If you don\u2019t, somebody (read: your competitor) will. Keep your pride aside and don\u2019t forget that every customer counts whether they are right or wrong."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/5-reasons-restaurant-fail/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "Nobody starts a business thinking about failure. Everyone wants to flourish and grow. More so for someone who has opened a restaurant. We all know how much money it takes get a restaurant up and running and it doesn\u2019t stop with just opening the restaurant. \nThe recurring costs, maintaining the restaurant and other operational expenses keep burning that hole in your pocket. After a few years in the business, you can let the operations run like a well-oiled machine. Until then, you need to pay attention to every detail in the restaurant. A small oversight could lead to a restaurant\u2019s failure. Let\u2019s talk about at least 5 such reasons why a restaurant could fail. Maybe you already know, maybe not and you could use these tips to avoid any problems.\nHygiene\nIt\u2019s a no-brainer and something highly obvious that every single restaurant should know by now. Hygiene (or the lack of it) is probably the most important reason why customers won\u2019t return to a restaurant. People are very forgiving of dishes being average, overly salty, underwhelming and the likes. But if there\u2019s a hair in the food and unclean cutlery, or even worse \u2013 a rodent running around in the restaurant, you not only won\u2019t see that diner again, but they will ensure a bad review for your restaurant is left on every social media platform so that others don\u2019t visit either. You can\u2019t quite stop the ripples effect. Because of which, you should get regular checks done at the restaurant \u2013 dining area as well as kitchen. Moreover, you don\u2019t want to be slammed with huge fines you can\u2019t afford like we talked about it in \nthis\n post earlier.\nService\nThe restaurant business is a hospitality business and service is key to survive. Do the right thing and hire the right people to begin with. There\u2019s no perfect formula to instantly know who the right ones are, but with a little effort and attention, you can at least avoid the wrong ones. The point being, good people give good service. No amount of training will make a staff member genuinely smile at a customer and go that extra mile to make sure they have a great time at the restaurant. The least you could do as the owner is have conversations with them and help them understand why service is important and how it drives business. People have returned to restaurants over and over again because of a few good people in there ensuring they are well taken care of. In today\u2019s world,\u00a0if you read most restaurant reviews, service is one of the parameters for a good or bad experience. Haven\u2019t you read about how restaurants deny service to a diner or someone getting into an argument with a customer over something petty splashed across online magazines and portals? Bad publicity is never good publicity for a restaurant.\nFood\nIt\u2019s obvious, but important point. As mentioned earlier, many customers are forgiving about average food once in a while. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can slack in this area. Food is your product. If the product doesn\u2019t sell, you will shut shop. You can splurge on decor and fancy artefacts, you could have the best staff but if your food isn\u2019t up to standard, no one\u2019s coming back. This is when you have to take customer feedback seriously\u00a0and use it to improve your menu. But sometimes you need to zoom out and take a step back. Ingredients and produce make all the difference. Make sure you\u2019re working with the right vendors and get the best for your money. Don\u2019t push old stuff off the shelves, ensure there\u2019s no cross contamination happening in the storage areas, reinvent and offer the best food you can.\nAdvertising\nNot advertising in today\u2019s competitive times is not a clever move. If you think you\u2019re saving money by not investing back in the restaurant, you are wrong. Marketing is crucial to any business. How are you going to let potential diners outside of your area (or even within) know about your restaurant? Restaurateurs go to great lengths to make sure the most number of people at least know they have opened their doors. Not very long ago word-of-mouth and a few pamphlet inserts in newspapers were enough. But those were also the times when the number of restaurants in town were limited. Today restaurants are sprouting in every lane of every city. It\u2019s hard enough to survive, let alone stand out. \nZomato\n, Facebook and Google are enough to cover your advertising needs and to maximize your reach in the city. Utilize these options and invest wisely in spreading the word.\nOwner\nAs the owner, you have to be involved in your restaurant. It\u2019s great if you have hired the right people to help you run the restaurant. But it shouldn\u2019t stop you from being actively involved in everyday activities. If you have invested in a restaurant and its staff, you have to be more hands-on in its operation. If you as the owner take no interest, why should you expect the staff to? From knowing your suppliers to keeping every check on cash flow, you need to be doing all of it. Taking keen interest in your restaurant will keep your staff alert and on their feet. If you\u2019re slacking, they are too. A few tips on\u00a0being a \ngood restaurant owner\n."

        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "Any retail outlet has a black hole that sucks up money like nothing else. A restaurant is no different. Most owners easily get carried away and spend large amounts of money on decor and equipment that they can easily do without. We spoke about this in one of our previous posts about the \nthings new restaurants splurge on\n. There\u2019s no end to the number of ways you can cut costs in your restaurant. Not just one time cost, but also avoid recurring ones. Invest in what will bring you back your money \u2013 menu, ingredients, produce, marketing, etc. Anything else, you can find ways to curb your costs fairly easily. Let\u2019s look at at least three of them here.\nDo away with the frills\n\u2026quite literally. How many restaurants today have tablecloths? It\u2019s unnecessary and simply keeps adding to your expenses. If you don\u2019t have them go begin with, you cut the cost of it right there. No tablecloths, no dirty linens \u2013 so to speak. Moreover, baren tables look a lot better without anything on them. It\u2019ll give your restaurant a more relaxed and rustic look. Look at second hand furniture and check out artifacts at flea markets to get decor pieces at a bargain. Even your plates can come cheap. Look at all options \u2013 glass, earthenware, copper, etc. Measure what weighs less on your pocket and go with it. Don\u2019t be afraid to mix and match. Give your restaurant an eclectic feel with such creativity while sticking to your budget.\nSave them trees\nA few of them, at least. It\u2019s not an entirely undoable option. There are restaurants and cafes that have a really small regular menu printed on very little material and then they have a large black board with the mains and other specials. This way you save on printing costs and are able to rotate the menu whenever you please. It\u2019s also a great way for your staff to engage with customers and talk about the food. Do away with tent cards and other distractions on the table. Rather have the waiters talk to the customers about offers at the restaurant. Again, these can also go up on a blackboard.\nTo market, to market..\nYou have your vendors supplying you whatever you need \u2013 meat, fish, vegetables and other produce. But if you can find a farmers market or a good market for produce, you should cut back on your supplies from vendors and make a couple of trips to these markets. In addition to reducing costs, you\u2019re also getting produce fresh. This is how you can also find seasonal produce earlier on and whip up some really nice specials for your customers. Being a regular at these markets will also eventually lead to you getting the best stuff before others do. For instance, let\u2019s say when mango is in season and you make your trip to the market on time, even before the vendor brings you the produce, you can create some specials that day itself go give your customers something to look forward to next time. This works best for seafood. Seafood is brought in from Chennai and Mangalore. When you\u2019re there early morning you quite literally get the worm first."

        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "Owning a\u00a0restaurant sure is a matter of pride. It\u2019s unlike any other business. Most food lovers worth their salt (and spice), at some point, have dreamed of having their own place. It stems out of the sheer love of food and the idea of turning that love into something that would make you gratification and money (yes, in that order) in return. However, that dream doesn\u2019t last long when they realize the nuances\u00a0of the business and of the industry. One then understands that it isn\u2019t only about deciding what goes on the menu or overseeing the kitchen or even cooking themselves. If you love food and that\u2019s the crux of why you want to open a restaurant, you need a wake-up call before it\u2019s too late. It is of course important to be passionate about what you want to do, but at the end of the day, it still is a business. If you don\u2019t want to or can\u2019t deal with the business side of things, you either have to learn to do it or just let the idea go.\nIn this post, we\u2019ll share (or bust) a few myths that are associated with opening a restaurant. It isn\u2019t to discourage anyone from attempting but more of a dose of reality. Certain frills need to be trimmed before you enter the business of restaurants.\nYou love cooking so you\u2019re going to do what you love!\nNot really. If you love cooking, opening a restaurant is not necessarily the goal. Having unbridled love for food and cooking is\u00a0a great start to get into the industry. But that\u2019s only the tip of the ice berg. There\u2019s a whole lot more to do before you actually get down to opening a restaurant. And if you\u2019re going to be the chef, you\u2019d rather start small. You read all about it in our post about \nopening a restaurant on a small budget\n. Alternately, you could start business from home. There are plenty of online portals that help home chefs cook and sell their food commercially. Home bakery is another option. What you do here is, build your brand and test the waters. If it works\u00a0and your food\u2019s a hit, think about a full blown restaurant or a cafe eventually.\nYou\u2019re going to be a hotshot restaurateur!\nMaybe, maybe not. It has been a fantastic few years for restaurateurs. No longer are they just the owners and working behind the scenes; nowadays, a successful restaurant owner is recognized and talked about too. Take, for example, Zorawal Kalra or Manu Chandra. There are other star chefs like Kunal Kapur and Ritu Dalmia. So many young chefs and business people look up to them. It\u2019s great to do so. But to think that you\u2019re going to open a restaurant and be instantly validated\u00a0and recognized is another thing. Becoming a star or famous shouldn\u2019t be your goal, becoming a good restaurateur should be. Everything will fall into place once you do your job right and well. Work towards winning customers\u2019 loyalty than personal recognition. All the restaurateurs mentioned earlier have gone through a journey and continue to do so. No one saw instant fame. But that shouldn\u2019t stop you from dreaming and turning your dream to reality.\nYou\u2019re finally going to make lots of money!\nNo. Just, no. In fact, for at least 3 to 5 years you\u2019re going to go the other way and lose money. From repaying bank loans and investors to maintaining the restaurant, you\u2019re going to need a lot of money. Pretty much every penny you make in the first few years is spent on the business. The first few years you\u2019re nurturing it and getting it to stand on its own. These are the years you are your best and most passionate. But it is also a time when you would want to give up because you realize it\u2019s not a piece of cake, so to speak. The ones who stuck it out are the successful restaurateurs\u00a0you see today. You can ask any restaurant owner about making money and they\u2019ll tell you to forget about money\u00a0for the first few years if you want to own a restaurant. It\u2019s all about working hard and building the restaurant before you see any real money."

        "title": "5 Best Ways To Promote Your Restaurant",
        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/5-ways-promote-restaurant/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "If it improves business, then any small change or addition is valid. Be it in the restaurant industry or otherwise. Promotions make for a great way to bring back old customers and create a new pool of new ones. Everyone needs a hook to come into your restaurant. With fairly good food served in many restaurants today, promotional activities help give you an edge. Depending on the kind of restaurant yours is, the promotional activity will vary. Another factor to consider in is the size of your restaurant. Ranging from a food and wine pairing and tasting event to a \nfestival special promotion\n, the kinds of promotions you can do are limitless.\nWhat a promotion draws customers in and creates a buzz in social media which then brings more customers in. That\u2019s the kind of chain reaction you\u2019re looking for. Now, not every promotion has a 100% success rate. It will depend on location, kind of restaurant and of course, the timing of the promotion. Let\u2019s look at a few fuss-free options you can look at.\nDiscounts and combos\nFor casual dining restaurant or a cafe, discounts or combos work really well. Particularly if the restaurant is in a location with colleges and smaller offices around. People in the age group of 18-25 aren\u2019t looking to spend a lot of money during weekdays and prefer quick and affordable meals. This is where you can create high value at low price. This isn\u2019t something new that restaurants are doing. The idea of clubbing dishes together and slashing the price has been known to have worked for many years. Customers see value in paying less for 2 or 3 items on the menu sold as a combo, as opposed to paying full price for the same dishes. In the recent years it hasn\u2019t been just the fast food chains that are doing this. Indian and Chinese cuisine restaurants have also been serving combo meals like one rice dish, one curry/gravy and an appetizer for a certain price.\nHappy hours\nThis is a no-brainer. If you\u2019re a pub or a bar, happy hours is bound to bring in customers. The offer you\u2019re going to give is crucial here. Not just that, you have to be crystal clear about the offer as well. Happy hours in most establishments for the longest time gave one free drink for every drink ordered. And many diners still believe this is the definition of happy hours. But that has changed over the years and we have seen happy hours where the second drink comes with a 25% off and many other such discounts. It\u2019s always better to be upfront about the offer than be vague and confuse the diners. Again, this promotion is stress free and doesn\u2019t require additional resources to pull it off.\nLive gigs\nOkay, this one will require some effort \u2013 planning, scouting, space management, equipment, etc. If the band/artiste will take care everything, you\u2019re good to go. Otherwise you\u2019ll need to get a few things sorted before hand. But once you do, you\u2019ll not only have new diners coming in to check out the event, but also you will also convert most of them to regulars. The nature of entertainment is up to you but do your research and find out what\u2019s hot in the market these days and what will work in the location you\u2019re in. Live band is a classic and with the right kind of music, you\u2019re sure to draw in some music lovers. These days many restaurants host stand up comedies. Besides, there are poetry slams, book readings and karaoke.\nSpecials\nIf you\u2019re unsure of starting something of a routine, you can start off with special days and test the waters. For example, Oktoberfest. You\u2019d think it\u2019s only a pub special. But there have been casual dining restaurants and cafes that serve Oktober special menu with a few German dishes and if they serve alcohol they team it up with a couple of German beer. It\u2019s simple, but it\u2019ll get people to try out something new and they\u2019d look forward to coming back to your restaurant for such specialties. Another way of getting into the promotions game is to create festival special menu. Pongal, Ganesh Chaturti, Diwali, Navratri, Eid, Easter, Onam and so many more festivals when you can chalk out a small specials menu just for the occasion. And most festivals give you scope to run the promotion for up to a week, if not longer.\nStand out\nBesides these popular promotions, you could do events like contests, quiz, themed meals, wine tasting, beer tasting and so on. Pub quiz are great fun for the restaurant and diners. Keeping it interactive will make the restaurant lively and more and more customers would want to be a part of it. If you want a more sophisticated event, try wine tasting. You could tie up with a wine brand locally and do a 3 or 5 course meal pairing it with the right wines. You could do a dessert buffet if you\u2019re up for it. Food festivals are always a safe way to bring in more people into your restaurant. A seafood special week or biryani from across the country, a regional special or an all out vegetarian thali special \u2013 the possibilities are endless. Once you begin such promotions, make sure you advertise them so it reaches the right audiences."

        "content": "MasterChef needs no introduction. We know how the original\u2019s (British)\u00a0spin off\u00a0show in Australia took television by storm in 2009 and spread across the world like fire. One of MasterChef Australia\u2019s largest viewership comes from India and the judges too have acknowledged it during their Indian trips. It was only natural for MasterChef India to take form and give\u00a0home cooks a platform to showcase their talent.\nIn the past 5 or 6 years, food has been on everyone\u2019s lips and on their phones, TVs and pretty much everywhere they lay their eyes. Social media has played an important role here.\u00a0People began feeding Instagram pictures of food they\u2019re about to eat and other platforms followed. When we live in such times, it isn\u2019t a surprise when MasterChef became a household name. It is often joked that we look at all the fancy food cooked by MasterChef Australia contestants on TV while eating our bowl of dal-chawal (which certainly is the clear winner, by the way). When the show\u2019s Indian counterpart began airing, we even saw Indian food in a new light. This time around though, the show is in top gear and raring to go.\nHaving associated with the Australian franchise in 2015, it was now time to shake hands with MasterChef India. Zomato, along with Star Plus hosted\u00a0a meet at \nMasala Bay,\u00a0The Taj Lands End\n in Mumbai on Saturday, the 1st of October. There were top Zomato reviewers, food bloggers, Instagrammers and home chefs along with MasterChef India\u2019s judges \nVikas Khanna\n, \nKunal Kapur\n and \nZorawar Kalra\n. All the guests introduced themselves along with their blogs to the judges and shared their food story that got the conversation going. They also got a sneak peak of the first episode of the show that premiered on TV the same evening.\nAward winning chef Amninder Sandhu wowed everyone with her delectable 3-course menu based on her years of experience in Indian cuisine. The guests and judges discussed how being a chef is all about passion, determination and creativity.\u00a0If cooking is a hobby, it will only be that. It requires real talent to take it to the next level. That was something everybody agreed upon.\nThis wonderful event was live streamed on Facebook, thanks to Star Plus\u2019 digital team."

        "content": "Remember watching Hollywood movies and sitcoms where the characters would walk around town and stop at food trucks to get their meals? Cinema\u00a0have always had a huge influence on food across the globe. But in India, our version of the \u2018food truck\u2019 had been the local chaat stalls. Thankfully in the past few years we\u2019ve seen a wave of change. Chaat stalls have gotten cleaner and more hygienic, no longer were Kolkata and Mumbai the only cities known for street food. Bangalore\u2019s streets lined up with dosa trucks and Chennai\u2019s beaches saw fried fish stalls.\nIt wasn\u2019t too long before we saw American inspired food trucks on our streets. As far as I remember, one of the earlier trucks were found in Koramangala, Bangalore and there was no looking back after that. From BBQ\u00a0style to simple home style food, food trucks began sprawling across the country. Today, all the metro cities in the country have a number of food trucks making the rounds. Some of the earlier ones have gone on to growing their business and running multiple trucks at multiple locations. If you\u2019re passionate about food and have wanted to crack your way into the business, food truck may be the solution.\nThe truck\nWhen the idea of a food truck was relatively new, probably around 2011-2012, people transformed a tempo traveller into one. All was needed to be done was to remove the seats and fix the required equipments. But now there are food truck manufacturers located in different parts of the country who will set your truck up and even transport it to you. Couple of such manufacturers are Amigos Food Trucks, Noida and Food Truck India (FTI). They will not just get your food truck done, but also guide you through the FAQs of setting up one like the paperwork and other permits, and even financials.\nPick your spot\nIt might seem like the last thing you\u2019d think about or the easiest bit of the whole process. But location scouting is just as important as the rest. Maybe even more. Where your truck is parked will determine the success or failure of it. Yes, you do have the convenience of moving it around but picking a spot in a certain area is still crucial. You run a food truck and you need regulars too. One of the common problems food trucks may face are objections from homes and restaurants in the locality. Then again, for each time you want to change your truck\u2019s location, you might need to get the required permits for the same. You location is also dependant on the food you serve. For example, if your truck is in an area with colleges around, your menu should cater to people in the age group of 18 to 22 and with affordable prices. Whereas with corporates, you can go with a full menu with flexible prices.\nOn the grill\nWhy food trucks are on the rise is primarily because the owners are more passionate about food than money. And they have found how starting a food truck is relatively easier than open a full-fledged restaurant. When you\u2019ve figured out the details of the truck and the necessary papers you need to get it on the road, think about the kind of food you want to serve. Well, you might need to figure that out when you\u2019re going to customize your truck. The customization should be according to what you\u2019ll serve. If you\u2019re serving burgers you need the right kind of grill, if it\u2019s dosa you need the big griddle, and so on. If you do your research right, you\u2019ll be able to find tricks and tips on food prepping and cooking with a food truck. Most of the food is usually prepped and very few kinds of food should need to be cooked on order. Just ensure you don\u2019t bite more than you can chew. Don\u2019t take on miscalculated risk of serving food that might require too much prepping or too much cooking on the spot. You want to serve easy yet delicious food. Think of flavours, think of convenience \u2013 for you and your customers."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/spotless-restaurant-kitchen/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "As glamorous and exciting as owning/running restaurant may seem, there\u2019s a whole other side that people don\u2019t get a glimpse of. Besides the work that goes into running a kitchen and the front house, and to consistently produce amazing dishes so customers keep returning to the restaurant, there\u2019s the routine work of keeping the restaurant clean. Sounds like a drag but it is the single most important part of a restaurant crew\u2019s job. Without a clean restaurant, nobody is going to come in for the food; however amazing it may be.\nYou may have the best plumbing and other services on speed dial, but if the hygiene levels of your restaurant \u2013 including kitchen and restrooms \u2013 aren\u2019t on point, you might as well get used to the dust settling on your furniture. Just last month, eight posh restaurants in Bangalore were fined heftily for unhygienic kitchens. Understandably, this would have been a wake up call for all restaurants who came to know of it. The gist of it being\u00a0that the BBMP authorities, along with health officers and Pollution Control officers, made a surprise visit to\u00a0a few restaurants in central Bangalore. They found the serving areas to be very clean but the kitchens\u2019 hygiene levels to be abysmal. Needless to conclude, there\u2019s no place for a rusty knife in your kitchen.\nHere are a few pointers to ensure you have a spotless kitchen.\nRoster\nNo, we\u2019re not talking about adding another gadget or equipment to your kitchen. A clean space is just as much as your team\u2019s responsibility as it is yours. Get a roster in place and get every staff member to help with cleaning along with the cleaning staff. And it\u2019s not just the scrubbing and polishing, if something doesn\u2019t belong in the kitchen \u2013 a dirty cloth or a pair of dirty shoes, let\u2019s say \u2013 it\u2019s not one person\u2019s job to get it out of there. Engrain this into your staff that hygiene is a part of their job too. If you see something wrong, hold everyone responsible so they know better next time. For the money you charge for a dish \u2013 however less \u2013 a customer deserves food that comes from a hygienic kitchen. And when every staff member shows high levels of ownership towards their work, you have nothing to worry about, not even hygiene.\nStorage\nKitchen storage space is a playground for bacteria if sound\u00a0care isn\u2019t taken. From meats marinating in there to chopped vegetables, from cleaned seafood to sauces \u2013 there\u2019s pretty much everything in there that can contaminate one another and, by extension, the food prepared using them. Food contamination can cause serious problems to the consumer. Exposing different meats to one another, keeping them in unclean areas of the kitchen, keeping cooked and uncooked foods together, and so on are few of the many mistakes made in professional kitchens even today. It isn\u2019t difficult to follow a few processes in the kitchen but yes, it does take some discipline. Running a kitchen isn\u2019t an easy task and everyone is on their toes getting things done in there. That\u2019s exactly why it\u2019s a good idea to take a step back and ensure such kitchen accidents don\u2019t happen.\nChecklist\nThis is a no brainer. You cannot not have a checklist to be sure every single nook and cranny has been cleaned down. It seems like a cliche, but a checklist makes sure you don\u2019t forget or overlook areas, gadgets, equipments that need to be cleaned. On a rotation basis, have one person responsible for this, if you aren\u2019t doing it yourself. The refrigerator, pantry, sink, stoves, restrooms, shelves, perishables, etc \u2013 all of these should be monitored closely and cleaned regularly. Label everything in the kitchen, especially food that goes into storage. Entry dates along with timely reminders will help you rotate your food as well so nothing goes waste. Even a small box of perishables can be pushed behind in the fridge only to later go way past its time of consumption and contaminate everything else around it. It costs nothing to be extra cautious.\n\u2014\nIn short, if you\u2019re busted for something like lack of hygiene, you not only lose money with the fines but also your reputation and customers. People pay for not just the food they are served at your restaurant but also for the service, and hygiene is probably the most overlooked and important\u00a0aspect of service in the hospitality industry. A few steps to take precaution will go a long way for your business."

        "content": "One of the most important things we\u2019ve been working on over the past year is making the process of online food ordering and delivery as simple and hassle-free as possible. While there are some aspects that we think we\u2019ve done well at \u2013 bringing customers the widest choice of restaurants in the country, and building a personalised and incredibly easy-to-use app \u2013 there are some areas that have immense room for improvement, the most significant one being delivery tracking.\nToday, we\u2019re excited to announce that we\u2019re taking a big leap forward in bolstering our delivery-tech capabilities with the acquisition of Sparse Labs, a logistics-tech startup that helps restaurants track and optimise their in-house delivery fleet.\nSparse Labs has developed a lightweight Android-based app, which transmits a rider\u2019s location to both the restaurant and the user in real time. The rider can use the app to receive route information, which helps ensure quicker and more efficient deliveries. The system also allocates orders to riders based on their proximity to the restaurant, and uses machine learning to identify a rider\u2019s familiarity with a neighbourhood to further optimise delivery efficiency. Restaurants also have the option of using a proprietary GPS tracker developed by Sparse, that can be fitted onto bikes. \nPankaj Batra, the founder of Sparse Labs has bootstrapped his product for over a year now, and is much loved by all his customers. He will continue developing his vision at Zomato, and the rest of the Zomato team is very excited to lend all their support to Pankaj going forward.\nJoining forces with Sparse Labs will allow us to significantly improve the food ordering experience on the app, by giving users real-time GPS-based status updates on their order. While we were already working on making this feature available for deliveries handled by our logistics partners, Sparse Labs will now help us enable delivery tracking for restaurant-owned fleets as well.\nAt the restaurant end, this technology will help make deliveries highly cost- and time-efficient, allowing them to optimise delivery routes and ensuring minimal wait time for riders. We\u2019ve always maintained that the most cost-efficient delivery fleet is the restaurant\u2019s own, where they can utilise the same staff during off-peak hours for back-of-house and marketing activities. \nSparse Labs will be renamed as\u00a0\nZomato Trace\n, and we will be rolling out the service \nfree of cost\n to our restaurant partners very soon.\nThe number of food orders being placed via Zomato is growing by the day, and we\u2019re constantly thinking of ways to improve and simplify the user experience. Zomato Trace is a big step in that direction, and we\u2019re looking forward to get this up and running to scale in the upcoming weeks."

        "content": "You have the funds and everything else you need to open your restaurant. Or maybe you already have. Either way, have you asked yourself what next? How involved would you want to be in the operations? Do you want to give the reigns to the manager? There are different kinds of restaurant owners. From chef-turned-owners to silent investors, their level of involvement also may vary. Regardless of the kind of owner you are, you still are responsible for the restaurant and how it\u2019s run.\nRunning a tight ship or keeping things relaxed around the restaurant is really up to you. As long as you get things done and get your staff operating like one single unit, things will be running like a well-oiled machine. You don\u2019t have to be a pushover, neither do you need to be a scary boss that no one can open up to. Strike a balance, innovate, inspire and constantly improve.\nDefine your role\nDefine your role before anyone else\u2019s. Create enough room for yourself to grow because opening a restaurant is only the beginning. If you have the vision to grow, you will need to hand over the reigns to someone else one day for you to move on to bigger things. As the owner, if you\u2019re new to the business, learn every trick of the trade by being a hands-on boss. Learn about every nook and cranny of your restaurant. Your staff is busy doing what they do. It\u2019s you who can zoom out and see the bigger picture. Once you know your own business like the back of your hand, you can slowly move onto working on growing it.\nKeep your staff close\nYour staff is the backbone of your restaurant. You might be in control but it\u2019s they who run the show. In today\u2019s times people switch jobs for a very small salary bump. Don\u2019t lose out on your best people over this. Learn what the market standard is, and pay them accordingly. Once you have that out of the way, train them as well as\u00a0cross-train them. No one aspires to be stagnant. A waiter aspires to be manager some day. The dish washing boy might want to be a line cook, and so on. Let them do the job they\u2019ve been hired for and when it seems like the right time, let them train to get to the next level or even another function within the restaurant so they understand the business better. This also works as an incentive for them to stay.\nTreat customers right\nAfter all this, you don\u2019t need anyone to tell you that without customers you won\u2019t have much of a business. Your restaurant might have the best decor, food and service, but without customers coming in, you\u2019ll have nothing to show for. A\u00a0foolproof\u00a0way of improving is paying attention to feedback. Customers always give feedback \u2013 online or offline. Talk to them while they\u2019re in the restaurant, ask them to give their feedback either written or online. If it\u2019s positive, thank them and move on. If it\u2019s negative, don\u2019t disagree or lash out at them. That\u2019s the last thing you want to do. \u201cBad publicity is good publicity\u201d probably doesn\u2019t work for a restaurant. You need to understand what went wrong and work on it if you have to. If they didn\u2019t like the food, there\u2019s nothing much you can do since it\u2019s a matter of personal taste. But if they have something to say about the service or an incident at the restaurant, or something about the food that you can fix, do it. It not only shows that you\u2019re a decent restaurateur, but also that you care about your business.\n\u2014\nYour team, your customers and yourself \u2013 these are what will be the foundation of a good business for you as a restaurateur. Excuse the\u00a0chich\u00e9 but a restaurant is as good as its last meal.\u00a0And for a customer to be pleased with a good meal, you need a good team in the restaurant. As the boss, you create and turn a group\u00a0of people to work well together."

        "title": "Why Your Restaurant Needs A Business Plan",
        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/restaurant-business-plan/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "First things first. Why do you need a business plan?\nThe restaurant industry is still known to be an unorganized one. Which is exactly why a business plan needs to be in place. It also is important to have a business plan so you can show your investors where their money is being put and even to get that bank loan you\u2019ve been waiting on. A business plan is the blueprint for your restaurant where you chalk out the restaurant\u2019s goals \u2013 short and long term ones, what your vision is for the restaurant and how you plan to make it a success. There are plenty of modules, guides and even softwares that can help you make these plans. But before any of that, you need clarity on what you\u2019re going to do.\nDefinition\nYou need to define your business for yourself and for the investors.\nWhat kind of restaurant will yours be? Cafe, fine dining, casual dining, QSR, or any other.\nWhat cuisines will you serve? Based on location, demographic and your own business interest, understand what cuisines will work for your restaurant.\nWhat will be the USP? A unique theme or cuisine, events, or anything else.\nA cafe serving American cuisine with a circulating library within the cafe and live music on Friday evenings. Here, the library and live music can be your USPs and something that customers will be drawn to.\nKey factors to succeed\nIn all businesses, there are a few key factors that ensure the success or failure of it. It\u2019s not different with the restaurant business as well.\nLocation \u2013 List of ideal locations and why you want to open a restaurant there.\nDemographic \u2013 The kinds of people you\u2019re targeting \u2013 age group, floating population or locals.\nStaff \u2013 Are you hiring experienced staff or new ones to be trained? What are your staff retention plans?\nFood costs \u2013 How are you going to control food costs? Have you spoken to multiple suppliers before finalizing on the ones that would work out for your business?\nStrategy\nInvestors need to know your strategy to success. We mentioned key factors earlier, but without a strategy, they are only just points on paper. From operations to staff, you need to have a clear strategy that you intend to follow.\nOperations \u2013 Number of people required in various shifts, whether you\u2019re going to be open all day or just for lunch and dinner services, supplier management, etc.\nHome delivery \u2013 Do you have enough staff to run delivery operations? You can sure improve on profit margins, but can you handle the volume? Will it work in the locations ideal to run the restaurant in? Will you use a third party for delivery or in house staff? Will you go online or stay off it?\nCosts \u2013 How are you pricing your menu \u2013 starting low and bump it after 6 months, or keep it stable for a year and raise it according to market later?\nFinancial analysis\nA business plan cannot be complete without a mention of financials. Even if it isn\u2019t elaborate, you need to cover the important points. Cash flow, profit and loss statements, risk analysis, pricing, cost control, operational costs, sales forecast, quarterly and annual growth rate, etc. It\u2019s not easy to work on financials if you don\u2019t have experienced people working with you to guide you in the right direction. There is a lot to consider at the beginning so you don\u2019t suffer later in the business.\nFuture plan and vision\nEven a restaurant, however unorganized the industry may be, should have a vision and a plan to achieve set goals.\nExpansion \u2013 Do you plan to open other outlets in other locations of the city? Financially, will you be in a position to do so in the time set to achieve this goal? Do you want to expand the brand or open different\u00a0kinds restaurants?\nDiversification \u2013 Do you intend to add cuisines? Or events? How else do you plan to keep your restaurant relevant?\n\u2014\nA good business plan should basically talk about what your restaurant will be like on paper and how you intend to run it bearing\u00a0in mind the financials and other practical aspects. You must have an executive summary for your business plan where you condense everything into just two or three pages. A lengthy powerpoint presentation is outdated and tiresome to compile as well as read. Keep it simple and as clear as you can."

        "title": "Are You Planning To Open For Breakfast?",
        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/planning-breakfast-service/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. It\u2019s also the best because you kickstart the day with food. For the most part, it can make or break one\u2019s morning. Gone are the days when you would wake up to elaborate breakfasts made at home, mostly by mothers. There\u2019d be aloo puri, paranthas, rava dosa, idli, vada, uttappam and what not! Gradually things changed around the urban Indian household. Corn flakes filled the bowl instead of upma, juice from a tetra pack replaced the tumbler of freshly made hot chai or coffee.\nIn metro cities, people are too busy to stop for a bite these days, let alone cook a breakfast and eat at a leisurely pace. Restaurants that serve breakfast have been playing a crucial role to help their diners get started with their day. More so since the rise of start-up companies, young working professionals want their breakfasts to be quick \u2013 to be served and to be consumed. More and more food establishments are leaning towards breakfast service because it\u2019s an extra stream of revenue without the madness of a lunch or dinner service. To make it even better, by only adding\u00a0a breakfast delivery service option works like magic when done right. Let\u2019s look at a couple of things before you can put up a board that says \u201copen for breakfast!\u201d, shall we?\nDo you fit the bill?\nA cafe, QSR, fine dining, casual dining, pub or a bar? Does your kind of food fit the requirement of a breakfast meal? Is your location ideal to serve and deliver breakfast? You need answer all these questions before going ahead with the idea. Commonly, besides fine dining restaurants the others mentioned previously have the required infrastructure to start a breakfast service or delivery, simply because they can be flexible in their styles. A fine dining, not that they can\u2019t, but the other factors like location and cuisine don\u2019t make them seem fit for a delivery service. A casual dining restaurant\u2014let\u2019s say serving north Indian food\u2014can serve parathas, aloo poori, lassi and the likes for breakfast. They will certainly have an audience for it. On the other end of the spectrum are pubs. A few years ago, pubs began to open their doors early to serve breakfast. And that turned out to be a huge hit. From appams and stew at the local watering hole to eggs Benedict at a posh pub, breakfasts in nightlife spots have become a weekend favourite.\nService or delivery?\nBreakfast service works perfectly well during weekends. Everyone\u2019s relaxed and walk into a cafe or a pub for breakfast at leisure. It\u2019s also a great time for diners to catch up with friends and family and spend time with them over food. But on weekdays, busy office goers don\u2019t have the time to spend 30-40 mins in a restaurant the first thing in the morning. But they do need breakfast. If you connect the dots here, you\u2019ll know that it reads \u2018delivery\u2019. You don\u2019t even need to open your restaurant\u2019s doors for service. Just get the kitchen going and the delivery staff ready. Ideally, people get to office by 9 and between then and 11 AM is your breakfast window. If you\u2019re going the delivery way, make sure the food you\u2019re sending out is suited to be delivered. For instance, egg dishes are great, but not something like egg Benedict. That\u2019s ideal to be served in the restaurant.\nWhat\u2019s cooking?\nIf you\u2019re going to do this, get your breakfast menu ready. Sit with your chef and chalk out what can be done for breakfast in short time. If you\u2019re a casual dining restaurant serving American style food, it\u2019s a no brainer for you to serve omelettes, pancakes, waffles, sandwiches and the likes. They\u2019re low on cost and high on value. On the other hand, Indian style breakfasts like idli, parantha, poori, kachori need a lot of time in prepping and cooking. But again dishes like poha, upma and vermecelli are the ones that wouldn\u2019t take as much time to prep and cook. As mentioned in our older post about \neffective menus\n, keep it short and crisp so the options are clear and the customer won\u2019t need to waste time browsing the menu. What you\u2019re looking to serve is quick to make and quick to serve dishes that are delicious yet not elaborate. Which means low cost and high value.\n\u2014\nConsidering your location is ideal for either a dine in service or delivery, and that your competitors are not serving similar food, you\u2019ll be fine. Before you go all out with breakfast service, do give it a trial run to see if the neighbourhood warms up to you. Invite a few people in, send out breakfast sample deliveries to your loyal patrons and get some feedback so you can improve on it even before service begins."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/our-take-on-the-mocambo-incident-in-kolkata/",
        "author": "ruchikanarang",
        "content": "For the past few days, the internet has been awash with outrage over the incident at the legendary Mocambo restaurant in Kolkata. For those not in the know, a guest was told that Manish, her chauffeur, couldn\u2019t be seated along with her at the restaurant. The restaurant\u2019s reasons for this supposedly swayed from Manish being \u2018inappropriately dressed\u2019, to them alleging he was drunk, and then saying a \u2018roadsider\u2019 like him could not be seen dining amongst the city\u2019s \u2018elite\u2019.\nThe incident has gone massively viral on social media, and everyone is up in arms against the restaurant. Since then, there has been a flood of reviews for the restaurant on Zomato \u2013 as many as 5000 in a day \u2013 and their rating has dropped from a very respectable 4.3 to a disastrous 1.8.\nNow, many (if not most) of these reviews have been written by users who admit they haven\u2019t been to the restaurant, and probably never will. Our policies and algorithms are tuned in a way that detects and deletes these reviews automatically.\nBut there\u2019s a catch \u2013 whenever there is an outpouring of negative reviews for a particular restaurant, our anti-spam systems take a pause, and flags the issue to our moderators as a potential \u201csocial issue\u201d. And a social issue this is.\nIn these exceptional cases, we have to deeply analyse the situation at hand, and then take a call on whether or not we should delete these reviews by marking them as junk/spam, and for not reflecting a real, first-hand experience with the restaurant. In this case, it was a \nvery\n hard call for us.\nHere\u2019s why \u2013 while we agree that Zomato is a technology platform that shouldn\u2019t take sides, and should stick to the rule book that we have created for ourselves, in such social cases, we have to look deep within us and ask ourselves the question \u2013 \u201cwhat is the right thing to do?\u201d.\nSo what, according to \nus\n, is the right thing to do?\nWe think \nevery\n hospitality business should have basic ethical guidelines and principles. If the customer\u2019s side of the story is true, it is deeply upsetting for us. We agree that the management reserves the right to refuse admission to someone, but there\u2019s a \npolite\n way to turn a customer down, and then there\u2019s an absolutely \nunacceptable\n way to turn someone away.\nThis incident, if indeed it happened verbatim, highlights the elitism of some \nhospitality\n businesses in India. Of all the countries that we operate in, India is the only one in which we hear of such incidents on an ongoing basis. It\u2019s taken us centuries to supposedly move away from the class system, but traces of that still remain within our society. Such incidents is when things blow up and the chinks in the armour of our modern society become visible.\nHowever, \ntheoretically\n, the event may not have panned out exactly the way we were told it did, and the details posted by the customer in the original Facebook post could have been exaggerated. The customer could have just had a long and tiring day, and the fact that the restaurant exercised its right to admission \u2013 politely at first, and then assertively \u2013 led to her venting her sentiments on social media. And that, in turn, sparked a massive backlash against the restaurant.\nWe all know the social media mob attacks \nreally\n well. And that\u2019s what is happening here. There\u2019s a mob attacking and voicing their opinion on an issue based on one side of the story.\nOur goal is to enable people to make informed decisions on whether or not to dine at a place, based on the real and personal experiences of people who\u2019ve been there. Therefore, an individual\u2019s opinion/review of a restaurant should be reflective of their own experience there. We don\u2019t want Zomato to be used as a tool for mob attacks \u2013 there are enough platforms being used for that already.\nSo again, what is the right thing to do?\nThe customer is entitled to her opinion, and has left a review on Zomato \u2013 that review will count, and stay on Zomato forever, for potential customers to read and decide whether they want to visit the restaurant or not. The business owner also has the means to reply to that review to present their side of the story. At the end of the day, any potential customer can decide whether to dine at that place or not.\nEvery other review, as a result of the mob behaviour that some of us show without understanding the real issue at hand, will be deleted very soon, and we will re-enable our automated anti-spam on this restaurant\u2019s page again.\nThat, according to us, is the right thing to do \u2013 and this is what our anti-spam policies were originally designed for.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nNote:\n Mocambo is not an advertiser on Zomato. However, our review policy is \u2013 and will always be \u2013 completely neutral. We do not treat advertisers differently from non-advertisers in any way when it comes to reviews and ratings. This has been, and shall forever be, our guiding principle as we continue building Zomato into the future."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/festive-season-promotions/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "Indian festivals are a joy when they come by. They bring family and friends together in celebration. With multiple religious festivals, there\u2019s all kind of merry making the rounds. But irrespective\u00a0of the background and details of the festivals, there\u2019s one aspect that truly unites everyone: food. Every passing\u00a0year, everyone waits around for their favourite festivals to come by mostly for the food that would be served at the time. Modaks during Ganesh Chaturti, Sadya during Onam, Biryani during Eid, Plum cake during Christmas and so much more!\nUnfortunately, a lot of people in urban India don\u2019t have the kind of time or mental bandwidth to cook a feast associated with the festivals they celebrate. Most of them order in sweets and get on with their celebrations. Indian restaurants at some point realized how they can come to their diners\u2019 rescue and began festival centric food festivals. Many people today who can\u2019t take the time out to cook tens of dishes (that consume\u00a0hours in the kitchen) opt for a feast prepared by chefs in restaurants. It makes for a great day for the entire family to spend together as well.\nAs a restaurant, you could promote your festive special meal online of offline, but if you aren\u2019t well prepared for what\u2019s to come, you are sure to miss out on a big opportunity to make the most of festive seasons.\nLet\u2019s break it down here.\nPlanning\nYou will need at least month and a half of planning before the actual day of the festival. Planning will include menu, number of days you want to run the promotion, marketing, decor and such. Before any of this, ensure you have the budget to pull it off. When you\u2019re planning a food-related event around a festival, make sure whatever you\u2019re going to serve goes with the general theme of your restaurant. If you\u2019re an Italian fine dining restaurant, it\u2019s odd to have an Onam sadya lunch at your place. But if you\u2019re a casual dining restaurant serving a couple of different cuisines, you could easily put out a Diwali special lunch and even a Christmas special dinner \u2013 it works for your style of restaurant. If you\u2019re the kind that serves predominantly north Indian and Mughlai food, sticking to Indian festivals for promotions makes a lot more sense. While you sit with your chef to plan the menu, keep in mind the\u00a0food costs and sourcing special ingredients. Let the chef know what your expectations are and how you can help them. Since you\u2019re not going to be the only restaurant serving these special dishes, plan way ahead and get in touch with your suppliers accordingly.\nMarketing\nOnce you have the menu down and your team is on board, you need to think about how you will market this. For instance, if you\u2019re doing a Diwali special lunch, it only makes sense to begin promotions a week or two in advance. The idea is to build it up to the day so you create and maintain a certain buzz around it. You have to let your regular customers and potential ones know in advance because it helps them make up their mind sooner. How will they know? If you have a Facebook page, you can update the promotion every two days so it acts as a constant reminder. You must also promote it where you will catch the attention of food lovers in particular: Zomato for Business. One of the first things a foodie does today is to log on to Zomato to look for food around them. When they type \u201cDiwali special\u201d or anything to that effect in the search bar, your restaurant will show up because you\u2019ve promoted the Diwali special lunch using Zomato for Business. This has now become a norm for restaurants to promote any kind of food festival or special events happening at their restaurant with Zomato for Business. Going the old school route of distributing pamphlets is basically money down the drain or trash can (where the pamphlet will eventually end up).\nCatch\nIn your planning stage when have the food, decor and marketing sorted, think about a catch that will reel customers into your restaurant and not a neighbouring one. Most restaurants will serve festive special food, but how will yours stand out? So many ways to fix this problem. What you need to do first hand is see what other restaurants of your kind are doing \u2013 food, the number of days they\u2019re running the promotion, anything else they\u2019re adding to the festivities, and the likes. One thing you have to keep in mind is that depending on the style of your restaurant your customers may or may not be bringing their families. If your customer base is mainly family oriented, it\u2019s wise to add something that would keep the children entertained \u2013 like a face painting artist or a henna artist. You could also set up a play area for the kids to play in. Live music is also a good idea if you can set it up. During Christmas in particular, live music with local bands is a great idea to keep your diners entertained.\n\u2014\nIt\u2019s a great time to\u00a0give something new to your customers and get the creative juices flowing for your restaurant staff. This is when chefs get to showcase their uniqueness and win diners over with their special menus. Plan ahead, execute it to the T and your restaurant will be the flavour of the season."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/5-tips-effective-menu/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "We don\u2019t live in a time when a diner has to come into your restaurant to get a glimpse of the menu. It\u2019s the digital age and diners already know what they want to eat from your menu even before they set foot into the restaurant. A couple of clicks on Zomato and the menu is on their screen. And in even shorter time, they know if they\u2019re going to that restaurant or not. Menu plays a key role in decision making today and not just ordering food. Menus have also evolved from plain text of 200 odd dishes on paper and laminated with plastic to them being professionally designed.\nAt a few restaurants, the menu is turned into a USP by playing around with designs and shapes of the menu itself. There have been newspaper style menus, menus on wine bottles, wooden planks, so on. What it says is that restaurants in the past few years have been investing in not only the content of their menus, but also the design and concept of them. In a previous post about menu pricing tips we spoke about only pricing. This time, let\u2019s zoom out and look at the bigger picture.\nGroundwork:\nCheck out your competitors\u2019 menus to get an idea of what kinds of design are current. This is only to analyze and not to simply replicate another\u2019s menu. One of the things for you to look at is the price point. What are the dishes priced at, and would you be able to compete with them? Will your dishes stand out against theirs, and will they be of more value to diners? See what kind of menus are out there. You can take inspiration from them and put your own spin to your menu.\nLayout:\nThe colour scheme and font of your menu should reflect the kind of restaurant yours is. The same colour palette won\u2019t work across all kinds of restaurants. A fine dining restaurant anywhere has a much cleaner and sharp looking menu when compared to a hip cafe. Either way, the basics still remain. Make sure the categories are well defined and well spaced. \nDo away with any distractions like animated images or pixilated food pictures. They don\u2019t add any value and will only create clutter on the menu.\nDescription:\nWhen your menu is clean, tight and well laid out, you can have descriptions that help the diner further with making an informed choice. The idea is to highlight the hero of the dish along with one or two supporting ingredients. Avoid too many adjectives and over explaining a dish. For instance, using words like slow-roasted, crispy, caramelized, fragrant, and the likes help understand what the flavours of the dish might be. Keep it simple and precise.\nClean:\nWhen your menu is shorter and clutter-free, it eases the decision making process since the choices are limited. This is only because the more options one has, the more time they take to read through all of them and go back and forth. The more dishes on your menu, the more anxiety a diner goes through to make up their mind about what to order. The variety can overwhelm the diner only to affect their final decision. For instance, if the appetizers section has 15 dishes listed and a diner needs only one, it becomes a tedious process for them to make up their mind. But if there were say, seven options, it is less stressful to pick one.\nPricing:\nWe spoke about menu pricing in one of our posts earlier. However, it still stands to be one of the most important part of the menu. The way the dishes are listed on a menu and how the price is mentioned will always influence a diner\u2019s decision. For example, a dish priced at \u20b9195 seems reasonable when compared to one priced at \u20b9200. It\u2019s just a \u20b95 difference, but that \u20b95 tilts the scale in your favour. That\u2019s not it, though. Many restaurant owners get their staff to push the expensive dishes like large seafood platters, for instance. A seafood lover will opt for it when they are with a group of people. You have got to push the \u20b9195 dishes to keep afloat. When the pricey ones sell, it\u2019s value addition for you.\n\u2014\nIf you\u2019re still doubtful, just go with a simple black &\u00a0white menu. Don\u2019t overthink and ask for too many opinions. If you have a consultant, trust them. If you\u2019re doing this on your own, play it safe by keeping it simple."

        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "Opening a restaurant, however big or small, is a daunting operation. A number of reports have said only 50% of the restaurants survive their first year and the number further plummets after the first year. Even before you open the doors of your restaurants to the general public, there are various expenses to be taken care of. From zeroing on the menu to finalizing suppliers, from interior designs to crockery\u2013there\u2019s a long list of things to get done before opening. Not to mention the money that goes into all of these things.\nSuccessful business operations needs constant cash flow. Restaurants get a jumpstart with a fair amount of capital. There are a few who don\u2019t even have that. They rely on their savings from the past and money borrowed from friends and families. Either way, it\u2019s important to not overspend and be efficient with purchases. But you will always find a few restaurants going overboard with a few things in their restaurants that one could easily do away with and save money.\nDecor\nThe first thing that a diner sees is the restaurant\u2019s interiors. It\u2019s crucial to set the tone of the restaurant with the right decor. Hiring an interior designer who has worked with restaurants before is ideal. But if you don\u2019t have the budget for a designer, doing it yourself will definitely cut costs. However, it\u2019s easy to get carried away and fill your restaurant with things that don\u2019t add anything to its ambiance. For instance, if yours is a bar, lighting is very important. Consult a few bar owners or even walk in as many bars and pubs to see if you like a certain kind of lighting or fixtures. Work around it and make your purchases accordingly. The current trend for cafes is to have quirky interiors. But that doesn\u2019t mean your cafe has be filled with random things you find in the market. Mirrors with colourful frames are a great addition to the decor, but don\u2019t line your walls with a lot of them. Vintage looking decor pieces are also great, but not too many. Sometimes just one of these things add greater value than a whole bunch of them. And when you buy just one or two, you can get the good ones instead of ten cheap ones. Remember not to clutter. And you know what\u2019s not trendy? A big chandelier in the middle of your restaurant\u2019s dining area. It\u2019s tacky, gaudy, and it\u2019ll only be a giant and expensive distraction. Keep it simple and easy on your pocket.\nKitchen\nThis won\u2019t apply to all restaurants, of course. But the ones that it does, be sure of what you\u2019re getting out of all the fancy and expensive kitchen equipment you buy. One of the best way to go about setting up your restaurant\u2019s kitchen is to look at second-hand equipment. New ones will cost a fortune burning a big gaping hole in your wallet. Most restaurants opt for second-hand equipment to reduce initial costs. Once you get the motor running smoothly, you can slowly invest in buying newer ones for your kitchen. Having said that, don\u2019t compromise on what you need. If you\u2019re looking at buying commercial ovens, get it checked out thoroughly before buying a second-hand one. Get references as well for second-hand sellers from other restaurants. These days pretty much everything is available either second-hand or even on rent.\nReal estate\nWhen you have a plump looking capital, you\u2019re bound to spend it on important aspects. Location is one of those. Of course, location is one of the most important aspects of opening your restaurant. The right location can do wonders for business. Granted you want the best location in town to get those diners walking in and filling up seats. But a good location doesn\u2019t need to be an expensive one. A prime location will also have other restaurants that are already successful, driving you to spend even more on bringing the same customers into yours. Competition is a good thing, but if you don\u2019t want to burn cash, steer clear of upmarket locations. You can do the clever thing instead. Look at by lanes in these prime locations where the rents might not dry out your capital and you can survive the neighbourhood competition comfortably.\n\u2014\nWhen in doubt, leave it out. Don\u2019t overdo anything in your new restaurant. Except your food, of course. With food, you need to go all out. Give diners your best because that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to come back more for. Let go of the frills and keep it classy!"

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/standing-alone-among-chain-restaurants/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "Chain restaurants have a number of advantages like purchasing capacity, menu development team, big marketing budgets and great locations (for most, at least). However, it doesn\u2019t mean independent ones can\u2019t stand strong on their own. As an independent restaurant, if you aren\u2019t clever about how you compete with the giant chain restaurants in your vicinity, it is sure to affect your business. However, there are number of ways for stand alone restaurants to hold their own and coexist with the popular chain restaurants.\nProduct:\nOne of the biggest and best tricks you have up your sleeve is\u2014no prizes for guessing\u2014your food. Food is your product, and if your product isn\u2019t worth it, there isn\u2019t a point competing. Get your food right; change things around if you have to and make it worth competing for. When your neighbourhood chain is dishing out 10 burgers every\u00a0couple of minutes, you know you can compete with the quality of said food. This won\u2019t guarantee an overnight success or that the fast food goers will find their way to your restaurant. But it\u2019s a start and a good one. You have the flexibility to change your menu to make it more appealing and make tweaks that will help improve your food.\u00a0The chains have to go through a long process to get the same thing done. Use this to your advantage. And it doesn\u2019t stop here. Make sure you market the menu on the right platforms to reach your target audience,\u00a0to let potential customers and your regulars know about what\u2019s cooking.\nA li\u2019l something:\nAs an independent restaurant you can be a tad more personal with your customers by doing little things to get them back. At the end of a meal, give your customers a couple of cookies with the bill, or even a cupcake on the house, maybe garlic bread. It\u2019s sure to take them by surprise and ensure you remain on their minds. This is something that will certainly allow\u00a0you an edge over the chain restaurants. It\u2019s also hard for chain establishments to give personal attention to each customer. You can do it at your restaurant. Customization of dishes, special requests, and the likes are sure to work in your favour. Great service goes a long way. Even if you aren\u2019t sold on the idea of giving away food, you can sure have your staff give your customers the best experience. More often than not, service is why customers go back to a restaurant.\nPromotions:\nAs the owner of a stand alone restaurant, you have the luxury to market your restaurant and come up with various offers and promotions whenever you seem the time is right. For instance, you can bundle a couple of\u00a0dishes together and make it a combo offer and run it\u00a0for lunch or if you have a buffet spread, offer a beverage on the house with every buffet. Offers like these\u00a0are sure to catch the attention of customers and have them walk into your restaurant. Going a step further, you can also run events like karaoke, stand-up comedy, live music, poetry slam and the likes on a weekly basis to have a variety of audiences come in, giving everyone something they want and something to look forward to. You know the market better than a giant chain restaurant because you\u2019ve been there longer. Use that to your advantage and create market specific events and promotions to attract customers in. A chain outlet seldom\u00a0do that. Besides, they have to go for\u00a0pan nation promotions or offers, which may or may not work for every market. Don\u2019t forget to put up signs outside your restaurant to ensure people know about\u00a0the offers and promotions you\u2019re running.\nValue for money\nOne of the biggest reasons why\u00a0diners go back to restaurant chains for is value for money\u2014or so we think. For \u20b9250 they get a fairly sizable meal that is equally satisfying. That\u2019s why you\u2019d see college students flocking to these colourful outlets ordering burgers and all the frills that come with it. Get more for less is the mantra for big branded chain restaurants. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t\u00a0compete with it. Going back to promotions and offers, ensure these relay\u00a0the message of \u00a0value for money. Of course, it\u2019s not easy to bring in college students with limited money and want a lot more for a lot less. But you\u2019re not losing much by putting out these offers that might draw their attention. Promotions aside, you might need to revise your pricing to make it more competitive in the market. You can\u2019t be dishing out burgers for \u20b9400 upwards, when the chain burger joint is giving theirs for \u20b9200 as a part of a combo meal. If revising prices might set you back significantly, then you\u2019ve got to make the \u20b9400 burger into something that is value for your diner\u2019s money by adding extras like unlimited soft drink or extra fries\u2014the works. What gives you an upper hand is that you\u2019re a neighbourhood restaurant that serves great quality food.\n\u2014\nIt does look like a not-so-silent battle between David and Goliath. However, if you play your cards right and are clever about standing your ground, you\u2019ll certainly\u00a0survive the beast."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/picking-right-spot/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "Talk to any established or successful restaurateur today about setting up a restaurant and they\u2019ll tell you how location is the most important aspect. A restaurant\u2019s success or failure could be well determined by where it\u2019s located. Seldom do people\u00a0go across town to visit a restaurant that they\u2019ve\u00a0read rave reviews about. People don\u2019t have the time or patience to commute long distances for a meal. It\u2019s all about convenience these days. And it sure is something to factor in while scouting for a restaurant location.\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019ve settled for a spot at one of the best restaurant hubs in town. There\u2019s more to it from here. Is there a good parking facility? Are there too many restaurants? Is there too much competition for you to survive? There are so many questions to be answered and many more factors to be considered.\nWhat are you serving?\nLet\u2019s take a step back. First ask yourself why are you opening a restaurant. If you\u2019re passionate about it, you\u2019ll already have answers to most questions, like this one. If you\u2019re thinking of picking the location before deciding on what you want to serve, it\u2019s a gamble that could go either way. But looking at it purely from a business standpoint where you\u2019ve figured out the rest of the details, maybe this gamble would work. If you aren\u2019t, stick to what you know best. For instance, if you want to serve burgers, you should know what kind of burgers you want on your menu \u2013 gourmet or fast food. This will streamline the process of other factors like decor, staff, vendors and even location. A gourmet burger restaurant clearly isn\u2019t a suited to do well in an area filled with schools and colleges. What you then need to scout for is a slightly more up market, yet not highly premium.\nWho is your demographic?\nCorporates, college students, local residents \u2013 you need to know who are you targeting. Are these the kind of people that frequent the location you have in mind? Or is the mix of all these people and your location more trendy and hip? If you want to open a trendy bar or restaurant, a residential area is not apt. You need a location with floating crowd with high spending capacity. Take the time out to drive around in the city and learn about the different areas and the demographic there. Arun Prashant of \nTovo Infusions\n, Chennai, believes it\u2019s important to spend time in various locations.\n\u201c\nSpending nature of people varies with location as well. For some, money isn\u2019t an issue but cuisine is. Spending time in a location will give you an idea of the kind of people there and the kind of food that will work well.\n\u201d\nDo you have the budget?\nIf the high rents in plush areas make you cringe, a good option is to scout the area to find a spot off the main location. For instance, 100 feet road in Indiranagar (Bangalore) is one of the most sought after locations for restaurants. But also one of the most expensive ones. The best bet here is to scout the lanes off the main road that might work out better financially for you. Besides, finding a place a little away from the hustle and bustle of the main road will sure work in your favour. It\u2019s going to convenient for your customers to park and even keep things quieter, unless yours is a bar.\nDo you know your competition?\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019ve narrowed down the ideal location for your restaurant. Have you checked out the other restaurants in the vicinity? It\u2019s not a bad thing if there\u2019s some competition for your restaurant. It means more footfall. People are going to go a particular area in the city where they have a set of restaurants to choose from. After that, it\u2019s your job to draw people in and get them to stay. But check out your competition, their USP, price points, service and anything else that you need to know that might give you an edge over them or help you compete with them.\nIf you\u2019re clever (not to mention really lucky) to pull off the first mover\u2019s advantage, you set the tone for the other restaurants that open in the area. Like how when \nAdda by Striker\n opened in Sector 29, there weren\u2019t any others in the vicinity. Slowly others came along and today it\u2019s one of the most sought after locations in Gurgaon for restaurants. One of the partners, Subodh, believes that you need to understand the pulse of the city and location to take a judgement call of opening a restaurant there.\n\u201c\nIf you open a fine dining restaurant in a mall, how is it supposed to do well?\n\u201d\nLastly, if your product isn\u2019t up to the mark, location won\u2019t fix it for you. Get your food right and customers will walk in\u2014wherever you are."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/retain-healthy-workforce/",
        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "One of the restaurant industry\u2019s biggest problems remains to be of staff retention. Cleaning staff, waiters, chefs, managers are among the different job positions in a restaurant. Pay scales vary with the nature of job. But working hours pretty much remain the same for most, which are long. Sometimes really long. Working at a restaurant isn\u2019t an easy job and that\u2019s why it\u2019s not the most sought after industry to work in either. Regardless, you must not forget that you\u2019re building a team here. A team that will help your business run and grow. It\u2019s crucial to hire and retain really good people to work at your restaurant with you. After all, you\u2019re going to be spending most of your time with them.\nHiring:\nGetting it right the first time\nIf you\u2019re going to build a workforce that will help you run your operations smoothly, hire right the first time. If that doesn\u2019t sound right, just put together the cost of hiring, rehiring and everything in between. Hiring right means you will need put in time and effort. If you rush through the process, you will be stuck in a loop of hiring and rehiring\u2013unless you get lucky, of course. In order to meet deadlines of opening the restaurant, it\u2019s easy to overlook staff hiring and to assume you\u2019d fix the problem later. Every job in the restaurant is important and deserves the right person to do it. If you hire right, most of your staff issues are sorted.\nHomework\nWithin the process of hiring right, you should get a few basic checks done. One of the most important things that is overlooked is references. References are very important to verify and validate the candidate\u2019s credentials. It isn\u2019t enough just to see them on resumes or get them verbally. You need to actually verify them by calling their old bosses. Delivery staff should most certainly come with references, given the nature of their job. Don\u2019t outsource this to anyone else. Own it and\u00a0be responsible for the same.\nPain points:\nUntrained staff\nIf you have a few members in your team who aren\u2019t trained for the job, it sure is a painpoint. But then again, it depends on the job. For instance, you can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t hire an untrained or inexperienced head chef. On the other hand, you could hire waiting staff with less or no experience and get them\u00a0trained on the job. That\u2019s a gamble that could pay off.\nAttrition\nPeople quit jobs for various reasons and they do so frequently, too. One of the biggest reasons is, no prizes for guessing, money. Others include long hours, no training, too much being expected of them, and the likes. It\u2019s a tough job and not everyone is cut out to make it in this industry. Whatever the nature of the job, unless one is sure to want to work in the restaurant industry they must know what they\u2019re getting into from day one. Set the expectations right when they\u2019re hired so there\u2019s no room for ambiguity later on. If they still choose to go, there isn\u2019t a point fretting over it.\nRetention:\nToday, even major corporates have employee retention programs. It goes to show that attrition is a real problem everywhere. An industry as unorganized as the restaurant one can\u2019t have a \u2018retention program\u2019 per say but that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t work towards getting your employees to stay.\nCompensate\nThis isn\u2019t where you pull your purse strings. Not having a big budget isn\u2019t an excuse to underpay your staff. Ensure they\u2019re paid well and as per industry standards. It isn\u2019t new for staff to jump jobs for a measly salary hike. The least you could do is, pay them fairly well.\nTraining\nOnce a member is hired, you need to make sure they\u2019re trained for the job they\u2019ve been hired for. If you have already hired trained staff, good on you. If not, invest effort and time into their training. It pays off a great deal in the time to come. When they know what they need to do and acquire the skills for it, the job gets done well. This increases efficiency and overall morale of the team. It doesn\u2019t stop here though. One the ways to keep your team motivated is to cross train them in other aspects of the restaurant so they pick up new skills and can be shuffled around so work isn\u2019t monotonous.\n\u2014\nHaving mentioned all these points, the most important of all is respect. Everyone deserves it. Every member of your staff should be treated well and respectfully. Even if you don\u2019t have the time to appreciate their work, the least you can do is treat them with respect and see how they return the same with gratitude. You might be their boss, but you\u2019re building your business with their hard work. And you can\u2019t put a price on that."

        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "Before anything else, ask yourself why you want to open a restaurant? Do you think it\u2019s cool to? Do you think restaurateurs make heaps of money? If you have answered yes to any one of these questions, it\u2019s time you talked to a few restaurant owners to understand what it is to open and run a restaurant. It requires a great deal of passion and commitment. If you are indeed passionate about it, this could be perfect for you. But what about commitment? (More on that later.) First things first, capital. You might have what it takes, but you\u2019re struggling with funds. Don\u2019t fret until you have given it a serious shot. We read stories about people making big in it without much to begin with\u2014that could be you.\nWe spoke to Parikshit (a.k.a Parry) from \nCharcoal\n co-owned by Abhinav, Akhil and Jeevan in Hyderabad who shares his story and gives insights on how he started\u2014below a friend\u2019s house which was an old barber shop\u2014and where Charcoal is now after two summers.\nSmall and steady\nIf borrowing money from a bank or getting funded by investors scares you, you don\u2019t have to approach either of them. Save up or borrow from family and friends, as Parry puts it. If you\u2019re thinking of opening a restaurant for the glamour factor, you\u2019ll shut shop soon enough. Starting small gives you the advantage of making mistakes. It won\u2019t cost you as much as it would if it were a bigger set-up.\n\u201cWe started in a 10 x 8 room below my friend\u2019s house. It was a small barber shop that we tore down to open Charcoal. Not having come from money, we had to trim our costs and overheads to make our dream work.\u201d\nParry believes it\u2019s important to have a vision. If you don\u2019t have a vision, you won\u2019t know where you want to go with the business. Even if the business is small, having a vision will help you get bigger and better.\nConstant learning\nIf you have a cushion of money to fall back on, then you can open a restaurant tomorrow just because you want to. If you don\u2019t have that luxury, you must get your hands dirty and understand the business a lot more than only being the face of it. Starting small will give you ample opportunities to work with the chef, deal with suppliers and other nuances of the trade. If you don\u2019t know your own business, you can\u2019t expect to grow it. Key is to never stop learning. The more you learn, the better understanding you have of it. And that will help you grow it. You may want to start small, but you might not want to stay that way.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much to learn and the devil is in the details. Now is when you can sit with the chef and watch him work, talk to all the suppliers and understand that side of the business. You can make mistakes and not have to pay heavily for them. Now is when you can learn from them.\u201d\nEye on the ball\nWhatever you do, always have an eye on the ball. Restaurant operations isn\u2019t a piece of cake. It\u2019s a full-time job that requires you to be a part of it every step of the way. When you\u2019re constantly learning and have timely goals set for yourself, you can\u2019t afford to lose focus. Your first year should be spent in getting your product spot on. Get your food to a place where people will commute from across town just for it. You can set up your restaurant as nicely as you can, but if the food you serve doesn\u2019t match up, the place is going to be empty soon enough.\n\u201cForget making money for a year. That\u2019s not why you\u2019re here. Money will come later if you focus on food and the business. Cut corners and make sure you\u2019re serving the best food. That\u2019s the only reason why people will come to your restaurant, nothing else.\u201d\nParry winds up saying \u201c\u2026and don\u2019t forget to have fun!\u201d"

        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "There\u2019s no particular process or set guidelines to refer to when you\u2019re setting your restaurant\u2019s\u00a0menu up and deciding the price points. But the norm is to triple your food costs for a dish which would ideally cover the overheads and profit margins. Other ways restaurateurs go about would be to keep their prices slightly lower than competition\u2019s, a rough guess without careful costing, and begin at a lower price point only to increase it every six to eight months. The risk that comes with these methods is that it has a direct impact on profits and if you haven\u2019t already, your plan to break even in a short period of time. Pricing will also determine the kind of establishment you are perceived as by customers.\nWhat you need to factor in:\nThere are no set rules to how you should be planning your menu and its pricing so it results in increased profits. However, three simple tricks should help.\nClutter free\nHundreds of dishes doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to high order volumes. The idea of having so many dishes on one menu would be to cater to a wide variety of customers with varied tastes. But if you take a good look at customers\u2019 ordering patterns, you can be sure to eliminate a number of dishes from your menu. There might be dishes in there that require seasonal produce and when you have to tell customers that you aren\u2019t serving them at the time, it immediately puts them off and will definitely affect their ordering.\nDescribe to sell\nMost restaurants today make it a point to have a description under the name of the dish with the price across it. Sure, it gives the diner an idea of what the dish is. But depending on how the dish is described, it can influence the diner\u2019s decision of whether or not he\u2019d order it. The description is how you\u2019re going to sell the dish and the customer wouldn\u2019t mind paying for it once they\u2019re sold on it. This works particularly on expensive dishes. You know that crab dish won\u2019t sell itself to a seafood lover who\u2019s probably going to go safe with a fish or prawn dish.\nSomething special, perhaps?\nAdding a specials menu or having dish of the day\u00a0can create great value\u2014both for you and the customer. As a restaurateur, you can take a low value ingredient or produce and turn it into a high value dish by adding it to the specials menu. Since it\u2019s special, it\u2019s not on the regular menu, which diners wouldn\u2019t mind trying. The idea of it not being a regular dish, and that they won\u2019t get to pick from the regular menu tomorrow or next week might influence their decision.\nKeeping it safe\nLook at any menu and you\u2019ll see that a few\u00a0dishes are cheap and a few, expensive. Then there are a few that walk the middle ground. What you want as a restaurateur, is for customers to order all kinds of dishes across price points. But what you need is more volume selling from the those in the middle ground. If you look at menu page with dishes ranging from the lowest value, to the more expensive ones. The expensive ones are an add-on for you, the cheap ones won\u2019t move the needle but are necessary to have. The ones in the middle will keep you safe.\nOne plus one\nIf yours is a casual restaurant combining multiple dishes at one price will work great for you. A sandwich priced at Rs. 200 and a milkshake at Rs. 150 will see more orders as a combination of the two than separately, but at the price of Rs. 280. It\u2019s value for money for the diner and more volume of dishes sold for you. For instance, many casual dining Chinese restaurants today have a range of combos to offer. It makes sense for a diner to order a combo of noodles, rice, and a couple of pieces of an appetizer, as opposed to three separate dishes. For single diners who prefer takeaways or home deliveries, this works best.\n\u2014"

        "content": "The restaurant business looks like a glamorous one. Looks being the keyword there. It takes a lot of passion and a commitment like no other to run a successful restaurant. Certain investments in a restaurant are reflected in its decor, expensive cutlery and the likes. However, most\u00a0diners aren\u2019t aware of the cost that goes into what arrives on a plate in front of them. But then, that\u2019s not a diner\u2019s headache either. The responsibility of economics falls squarely on the restaurateur. Which is precisely why some questions are worth tackling: As a restaurateur, to what degree are you involved in managing food costs? Are you aware of hidden costs within your general food costs? Do you know how you can trim most of these?\nAs a golden rule, in a hurry to get operations up and running, you should not compromise on what goes into the food that comes out of your restaurant\u2019s kitchen. If you choose shortcuts and go cheap in order to cut down costs and increase profits, diners will be the first to\u00a0recognize\u00a0the drop in quality of food being served. As we know, for a restaurant, reputation is everything.\nOn the other hand, to serve (consistently) good quality food, if you choose to go with expensive imported ingredients your costs will hit the roof. Be wise with how you work with your vendors and use your supply of produce. Unlike many\u00a0other one-time investments, food cost is a recurring one. Which is\u00a0why you need to know how to control it in a way that\u00a0it doesn\u2019t eat into your profit margins.\u00a0\nYogesh Mukashi from Bangalore\u2019s Egg Factory gives us insights on a few smart ways to reduce food costs.\n1. Manage vendors\nGive yourself some time to zero in on the right vendors. Consider this to be as important as hiring your staff. Come to think of it, you ARE hiring a vendor. Meet as many vendors as you can. Ask for recommendations. Compare their prices to make an informed decision. It means, find the ones that provide\u00a0you good quality produce at a reasonable price instead of plain\u00a0cheap produce.\nIf you\u2019re hoping to include a healthy section in your menu with currently trending superfoods, ensure you plan this well bearing in mind how expensive the end product might be and how you would price it. The same principle applies to gourmet foods like imported cheese and other dairy products, cured meats, oils, and such. Another important factor is to be sure that you are getting what you paid for. Ensure the supplier gives you the exact amount of what you\u2019re being invoiced for.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very easy for suppliers to con you. For instance, you should make sure you\u2019re not getting 80 kilos instead of 100 kilos that you have been invoiced for. That can happen if you stop paying attention.\u201d\n2. Refine recipes\nOnce you have your menu down, it\u2019s time to calculate how much will one dish cost you per portion. Doing this will help you understand whether or not the food cost is high or low, and price your dish accordingly. If that\u2019s too much for you to do, refine your recipes. On paper, your recipe might be right, but unless your chefs don\u2019t execute it \nright\n it won\u2019t matter. Work on your recipes till they become a standard. Chefs also\u00a0need to understand the importance of food costs and how it impacts the business overall.\n\u201cRefine your recipe and bring it to a point where it\u2019s a standard recipe to be followed to the T by your chefs. They play a key role in the economics. Listen to them.\u201d\n3.\u00a0Revise menu\nYour food costs being high doesn\u2019t justify the frequent and steep bumps in menu prices. Take a step back before increasing the prices and have a good look at your what\u2019s adding to your costs. A root cause analysis will help you understand the situation better and find appropriate solutions. Adding a specials menu is a good way of keeping food costs in check. Ideally low value produce can be a part of the special menu to create higher value. By doing so, you also end up facilitating\u00a0variety to your customers. It is also a great way to keep your chefs motivated and have them innovate by going off the regular menu.\n\u201cFood inflation has been steep for the past 5 or 6 years. But that doesn\u2019t mean you simply hike your prices. The market won\u2019t be ready to absorb such hikes.\u201d\n4.\u00a0Manage waste\nThe ground rule says \u201cbuy what is enough\u201d and for a very good reason.\nPlan your purchases in a way that you don\u2019t end up wasting produce. Keep a log and keep a check on what\u2019s going into that waste bin. If you have to go through your bins to be sure, do it. By doing so, you\u2019ll be setting an example and your staff will be careful about unnecessary wastage. Be aware of the cost that goes into making a dish. If you see this eating into your time, appoint someone as a monitor in the kitchen. Planning ahead will also help with managing waste. Basically look at it as money being thrown in the garbage bin.\n5.\u00a0\nRotate stock\nThis would ideally be a step before you get to monitor waste. If you\u2019re smart with the stock in your pantry, wastage will also reduce. Label your stock with receive dates so you know when they got there and will give you time to use them wisely. A good option is to rotate the stock based on the \u2018receive\u2019 labels. Use up the older ones before laying hands on the newer stock. This in turn will help with waste control and eventually with cost control. Without knowing when you received something, it becomes a guessing game and invariably you\u2019ll end up throwing away food that could have been used on time.\n\u201cYou need continuously review ingredients because of price fluctuations and availability. At\u00a0times, the recipe will permit changes and at other times you need to completely drop it from the menu altogether.\u201d"

        "author": "Pallavi Shastry",
        "content": "Your restaurant is not only surviving but also thriving. It has passed the test of time\u2014of a couple of years\u2014and you are either going to keep it going or you\u2019re thinking of expanding. First or third, there are a number of factors that need to come together for a restaurant to be up and running. The first restaurant\u2019s success doesn\u2019t warrant you the success of the next one. In spite of having the advantage of experience on your side, you will still need to start work from the grass root level. Do you want to replicate your first restaurant, or do you want to change things up a little for the second one? Do you want to open it in another city, or stick to where you are now? So many questions you need to ask yourself before opening the doors to expansion.\nRegardless of the kind of restaurant you want to open, or where, or why, the two biggest and the most important factors that lead to it all materializing are market and location. Arun Prashanth of \nTovo Fusion\n in Chennai and the trio, \nAshwini Chaudhary, Subodh K Singh and Lalit Ahalawat of \nStriker Pub & Brewery\n \u2013 Gurgaon\n,\u00a0\nAdda by Striker\u00a0\u2013 New Delhi\n, \nAdda by Striker \u2013 Gurgaon\n, \nSoi 7 Pub & Brewery\n and \nWalking Street by Soi7\n,\n\u00a0share insights on expansion and why\u00a0these two factors are key to success.\nMarket for the product\n\u201cYou first need to understand if there is a need for your product in the market and whether you can grow your brand or not.\u201d\nArun Prashanth, who owns and runs Chennai\u2019s Tovo Infusions, strongly believes that one needs to study the market before venturing into expansion. With that comes understanding your customers\u2019 needs. In a city like Chennai, the demand for niche cuisine or style of food won\u2019t be as much in demand as, say, a biryani or local fare. Having said that, certain localities\u00a0that are dense with corporate offices and residents are more inclined to experiment and try out newer things. Another factor is whether there is a meeting point for your product and the spending capacity of people. The chances of a gourmet burger restaurant doing well in an area with colleges is less likely than a fast food restaurant.\n\u201cWith floating population in any busy area there\u2019s no real probability to survive. It\u2019s the residents that decide whether my restaurant will do well or not. They are the repeat customers as opposed to the floating ones.\u201d\nWhen you have an existing customer base, it leads to loyalty which in turn validates your brand. This is when you think of growing. Once you learn that there is a certain demand for your product in the market, you should now think of what will attract customers in and what is it that your restaurant has that sets it apart from a\u00a0neighbouring restaurant. \u201cIf I open a pub across an already established and successful one, I need to offer something that that pub across doesn\u2019t. I could keep my price points competitive or I could make the decor more interesting to draw more people in, and so on.\u201d\nArun believes that if you\u2019re planning\u00a0to open a restaurant similar to the ones already doing well in a particular area in the city, you must dine in these restaurants to understand what is it that they\u2019re doing that makes it click.\nLocation, location, location!\nProbably one of the most important factor of all \u2013 location. Understanding the demographic comes a close second, going hand in hand with location. While in conversation with \nAshwini Chaudhary, Subodh K. Singh and Lalit Ahalawat\n co-owners of Striker Pub & Brewery among others, Subodh asks \u201cWhen you decide to go out with your friends, where do you go? Don\u2019t you consider going to a popular area in town, like CP, Sector 29, Hauz Khas?\u201d When asked about how they opened Adda by Striker in Sector 29 during a period when that area had no buzz like it does now, pat came the reply with a smile, \u201cFirst mover\u2019s advantage!\u201d\n\u201cSometimes you have to go with your instincts. When you learn about a catchment area and its people enough to make a judgement call on whether or not your product will work there.\u201d\nAll three of them are passionate restaurateurs and tell me that passion for food and restaurants is why they don\u2019t replicate their restaurants. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point in opening the same kind of pubs in one city. We give customers different experiences at different outlets, so much so that one can\u2019t tell that the different restaurants are owned by the same set of people.\u201d When you\u2019re more\u00a0attuned to the happenings in the business\u2014which restaurant restaurant\u00a0is a hit, which one bit the dust, and why\u2014they become learnings from which you can base many of your operational decisions.\u00a0\n\u201cRestaurants and pubs in malls don\u2019t do well anymore. Five years ago, malls were ideal for restaurants, but now nobody wants to go there with the intention of dining.\u201d"

        "author": "sbasrur",
        "content": "This post isn\u2019t for the easily offended. If you\u2019re the type of person who puts 2 and 2 together and gets 5, I suggest closing this tab and reading no further.\n\u2013\nI was chatting with Oytun, our Turkey country manager, this past weekend, because I\u2019ve been quite concerned about what\u2019s going on in Turkey. I was worried about our team\u2019s safety and well-being (in addition to being concerned about the well-being of the world in general). Oytun reassured me that Turkey is a resilient country, that it always bounces back in about 2 weeks, and that I shouldn\u2019t be worried.\nThat thought stayed with me, and I figured that our traffic data in Turkey should very easily be able to prove the hypothesis that Turkey bounces back in two weeks. After all, the frequency of eating out is a fair indicator of how a country is reacting to a particular terror attack or situation.\nFor those not in the know, here\u2019s some context on Turkey. The country has seen more than its fair share of unrest in recent times. Since the start of 2016, they\u2019ve suffered a series of attacks and events that have put the country on high alert. Istanbul alone has seen three violent attacks, and been at the centre of an attempted military coup.\nEvery time one of these events occurs, we see a country that reacts the way any country in its place would: businesses pull down their shutters, people stay indoors, security measures are beefed up, and day-to-day life is disrupted. Sitting helpless thousands of miles away, it\u2019s terrifying \u2013 all we can think of is the safety of our colleagues, and pray that normalcy will be restored soon.\n\u2013\nSomething that\u2019s amazed us is how \u2013 every time, and without exception \u2013 our team carries on with business as usual (while taking all necessary precautions, obviously). We can put this down to their incredible resilience and work ethic.\nBut what about the rest of the city?\n Does it actually take Istanbul as a whole just two weeks to get back up on its feet and get back to life?\nOne rarely gets to see that from an outsider\u2019s perspective (and we were curious), so we started digging through Istanbul\u2019s traffic patterns on Zomato. Here\u2019s what we found:\nOur website traffic in Turkey drops by as much as ~50% in the immediate aftermath of an event, but recovers to its original point within ~10-15 days\n.\nHere\u2019s some data to illustrate this better.\nAttacks in Ankara (March 13th) and Istanbul (March 19th): \nThe attacks in Ankara on the 13th of March had a strong effect on traffic in Istanbul, causing a sharp dip in traffic. Just six days later, on the 19th of March, Istanbul was hit by attacks. However, the effect it had on traffic was nowhere nearly as dramatic. By the 27th of March \u2013 just two weeks after the attack in Ankara \u2013 traffic in Istanbul had returned to the point it was at just before the attacks.\nAttempted military coup across Turkey, July 15th-16th: \nBetween military-imposed curfews, widespread protests, and the declaration of a three-month state of emergency, Turkey seemed to be in complete disarray. By the end of the 16th of July, our traffic in Istanbul had dropped to almost nothing. But by the 30th, it had recovered the gap and then gone on to grow to 6% higher than it was on the 14th of July.\nInterestingly \u2013 but not entirely surprisingly \u2013 \ndelivery restaurants gained more share of the recovering traffic (compared to dine-out restaurants)\n after these events. Dine-out restaurants\u2019 traffic was also near normal within two weeks. What does that tell us? That slightly fewer people want to head outdoors to eat in the wake of any unrest, simply because it\u2019s safer to stay indoors.\n\u2013\nThe hypothesis was right: \ntwo weeks\n.\nIt takes Istanbul two weeks to bounce back from events that have rocked the city. It speaks volumes of the fortitude of the Turkish people, and their ability to get on with their lives.\nWhen I mentioned this to someone yesterday, they argued with \u201cYeah, but \nmany\n cities bounce back from adversity. What makes Istanbul unique?\u201d To be honest, \nwe\n don\u2019t have a benchmark to compare Istanbul to \u2013 and we hope we never do. No city, and nobody, should have to suffer what Istanbul has in recent times.\nThis post is simply a salute to a city with immense courage; a city that refuses to take things sitting down. But more than that, it\u2019s a tribute to my colleagues in Istanbul, whose unyielding and eternally positive spirit is an inspiration to us all."

It\u2019s all over your social media feed and if someone around you is walking around aimlessly trying not to hit a pole or trip over a stone, you know they\u2019re trying to catch \u2018em Pok\u00e9mons. Let\u2019s take it from the top. Pok\u00e9mon Go is a GPS enabled mobile game that projects various Pok\u00e9mon characters on your screen via the phone\u2019s camera. Your bathroom, office, gyms, salon\u2013they\u2019re everywhere for you to catch!\nWhere do restaurants fit in here, you wonder? Since these little characters are found in public spaces, restaurants turn out to be one of the spots for their chasers to get them. These restaurants have now introduced irresistible offers to convert Pok\u00e9mon Go maniacs to customers. From offering discounts if a Pok\u00e9mon is caught and a screenshot is uploaded on social media, to simply announcing that their restaurant is a Pok\u00e9stop, all kinds of restaurants are marketing themselves to the right target audiences. This augmented reality game has completely changed the way people have been playing video games. For starters, they\u2019re all outdoors. Restaurants are looking at this as an opportunity cost and are playing along by giving their customers offers that keep them in for longer. Play, eat, drink, and catch \u2018em Pok\u00e9mons!\nRead on to find out more about how restaurants in Sydney and Libson have warmed up to this game.\nCup Half Full\n, Surry Hills \u2013 Sydney\nCup Half full is located across the road from a very busy Poke Stop park in Surry Hills. Although Rowley, the owner, believes that \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go would help [his] business a lot more if the shop itself was a Pok\u00e9stop.\u201d\nThey are currently offering a Pok\u00e9mon Go special on the weekends where customers can purchase any plate of food to receive a free drink. This is to help incentivise Pok\u00e9fans to come into the cafe rather than \u201clinger outside\u201d.\nWhen asked about whether he plays it: \u201cYes, I play it. In fact, I take it way too seriously. I believe it is an unbelievable concept that\u00a0is encouraging people to get out and about and walk around.\u201d Rowley has also been giving tips out to customers and friends by suggesting they visit the Pok\u00e9 Vision\n\u00a0website to see where all Pokemon are so that they know where to walk. In fact, in his last meeting with his Zomato account manager, he interrupted business chat to give her a Pok\u00e9mon Go tutorial and show her how to use it.\nAbove all, Rowley from Cup Half full remains open to anything Pok\u00e9mon Go \u201cas long as it remains good for business.\u201d\nAndiamo Trattoria\n, Rhodes & Summer Hill locations \u2013 Sydney\nOwners of Andiamo Trattoria believe that because of Pok\u00e9mon Go \u201cthings for normal customers have changed\u201d and they are \u201cfearful that it might decimate their current loyal customer base\u201d. That being said, \u201c[They\u2019re] all for it, but there is always two sides\u201d. \u201c[They] have also definitely seen a shift in the core business that [they\u2019ve] been building because of Pok\u00e9mon Go\u201d\nNote: Rhodes is one of the biggest hot spots in Sydney.\nTang Hui\n,\n CBD \u2013 Sydney\nThey are very interested in attracting Pok\u00e9mon Go players and are now using it as a marketing tool.\nCopo Cafe & Dine\nr\n, Drummoyne \u2013 Sydney\nCopo Cafe is another lucky cafe to have a Pokestop across the road. Because of this, Cafe owner Danny believes \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go has had a big influence on the cafe as it has driven a lot of people to here\u201d\nCheck out\u00a0Zomato\u2019s \nPok\u00e9Nom Pitstops\n\u00a0in Sydney!\nPizza na Brasa\n,\n Bel\n\u00e9\nm\n \u2013 Lisbon\n\u201cPok\u00e9mon Go is a huge trend nowadays in Portugal, but once I got into the Zomato Collection I\u2019ve seen an increase of young people (the segment I\u2019m focused on captivating right now) going to our restaurant in Quinta da Fonte (Pa\u00e7o de Arcos).\nThe Pok\u00e9mon Go visits transformed into restaurant visits, due to the fact that most part of the kids that go there ask for an espresso or a glass of water and they are astounded to see the restaurant. So, they convinced their parents or, for some grown-ups, to go there with their wife or kids. Also, in visit stats it increased quite a bit comparing to other months \u2013 from 12 visits to 35 and going up. Even the presence on the Pok\u00e9mon Collection is highly regarding and valuable to us!\u201d.\nShawarma House\n, DLF Phase 4, Gurgaon\nNavneet Nagpal, who owns and runs Shawarma House, opened the doors to his restaurant for Pok\u00e9mon catchers and rewarded them with sodas, fries, wraps, platter and more, based on what level the player was at. \u201cWe ran it for three days and it brought us a lot of footfall, and the promotion did really well!\u201d, he said sounding excited. He plans to run the promotion again this week, so all the hungry catchers know where their pitstop is to fuel up!\nIn short, Pok\u00e9mon Go has stirred up a storm and it doesn\u2019t show signs of stopping anytime soon. And if you\u2019re a restaurateur, hop on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride!"

Our thoughts are with our team and everyone in Turkey \u00a0\u2013 the people who show an undying spirit in the greatest moments of adversity.\n\u2013\n\u201cWill we get there? Will we not?\u201d \u2013 Everyone at Zomato\nBefore the start of July, we knew that if we did our job well, we could grow our online food ordering business to a million orders a month in July. We kicked our planning into gear, and made sure that we did enough to get there. We came up with a plan \u2013 a day-by-day prediction of our order volumes for the entire month.\nThe first time we circulated a projection chart within the team was at end of day on the 3rd of July. This is what that chart looked like:\nA few days later, we were pleasantly surprised to see that things were going according to plan:\nI\u2019ll be honest \u2013 such things don\u2019t really happen \ntoo\n often at Zomato. We are usually over-ambitious, and often fall short of our own expectations. This time, us meeting our expectations was a result of two things \u2013 \n1)\n setting realistic expectations (even though the expectation would need us to stretch ourselves), and \n2)\n the team doing a great job and smashing out results one day after the other.\nIn general, my predictions have never been spot-on. So much so, even when I wanted just one kid, I got twins \ud83d\ude42\nThe fact that July had five weekends certainly helped our cause. Finally, at 8:23 pm on the 31st of July, we hit the million-order mark for July \u2013 and then we racked up another 20,000 orders before the night ended. This is what the chart looked like at the end of last night:\u00a0\nThe average order value (AOV) of our orders is holding well at ~Rs 480, and our unit economics have improved by 10% since the last time \nwe wrote about it\n. We now make Rs 23 per order as contribution margin compared to Rs 21 two months ago. Our customer retention has also improved sharply; in fact, our cohorts are now looking even more like a smile \u2013 a shape that lets me sleep well at night.\nNote that this cohort is for returning users \u2013 \nnot\n orders from returning users. Orders from returning users cohort looks even more exciting because of the ever-increasing frequency from retained users.\nCongratulations to our entire team, which has worked super hard to get here. But this is just the start, and we\u2019re going to power on keeping in mind \u2013 what got us here, will not take us there."

        "content": "Last year there were multiple predictions on what this year\u2019s restaurant trends would be. Some of them like chef-driven restaurants, emphasis on local produce and demand for healthy food have been predicted right and are going strong as we have crossed the mid-year mark. Others like spiralizing vegetables and fruits and underground restaurants didn\u2019t quite take off like expected. Let\u2019s take a glimpse of what this year has been like for restaurant trends.\nChef\u00a0in charge\nChefs are no more bound to just the kitchen any more. They\u2019re creating dishes along with a name for themselves in this competitive industry. We saw Saransh Goila completely change the perception of Butter Chicken. It sure is the country\u2019s favourite dish and just when you thought it can\u2019t get any better, Saransh reintroduced by tweaking it just a little and got Butter Chicken lovers to fall in love with the dish all over again when he opened\u00a0\nGoila Butter Chicken\n\u00a0in Mumbai.\nChef Nimish Bhatia who is the chef and owner of \nNimissere\n \nin Bangalore says that earlier only restaurants in a 5-star hotel were associated with high quality of food. Now with the acceptance of a high standards in restaurants, stand-alone ones are breaking that norm. Chefs have put in years of hard work and effort to get to where they are and they are now becoming a brand on their own. Besides, since they put everything on the line, it is natural for them give it their all.\n\u201cChef driven restaurants are done so with passion and not just as a business. Food is all about celebration and diners need a guarantee not to be disheartened with an experience. With chefs, they trust that their years of work will reflect in the food they serve.\u201d\nVidesi twist\nYears ago, restaurants began \u2018Indianizing\u2019 everything. As a result we got Gobhi Manchuri, Butter Chicken Pasta, Chicken Tikka Pizza and Tandoori Momos. A couple of years ago, things changed and tables were turned. Indian cuisine was given a modern makeover by top chefs like Manish Mehrotra, Manu Chandra and Floyd Cardoz. It\u2019s the same familiar taste we grew up with, but with a modern twist that validates the fact that there\u2019s no end to innovation when it comes to\u00a0food. Today every food enthusiast wants to get a bite of Misi Doi Cheesecake, Vindaloo Tacos, Tandoori Chilean Pork Ribs and most of what modern Indian cuisine has to offer. According to chef Nimish, serving one huge portion of Butter Chicken with Roti isn\u2019t value for your money, but trying out smaller portions of different kinds of food is. Cleaner and leaner are\u00a0surely the way to go.\nHealthy\u00a0signs\nAs fast food lovers are growing (pun intended), there\u2019s a section of food lovers that are counting calories and weighing in their food choices. More and more restaurants are including sections in their menu which draw in health conscious diners. From the rise in cold press juices and \nsophisticated\n\u00a0salads delivered to you any time of the day, it\u2019s safe to say this isn\u2019t just a fad. Restaurants are now adding vegan and gluten-free dishes to their dishes too. Bangalore had 10 healthy food based establishments open last year and in 2016, so far, there have been at least\u00a016 new ones in the city. Chef Nimish says there\u2019s no trans fat in his dishes. From the looks of it, adding a few such dishes will make your restaurant become an option for healthy food lovers as well.\nScroll down, order in\nThis year has seen a substantial rise in the number of online orders. According to our data, from January 2016 till June 2016 alone, there has been a month-on-month growth of at least 30% in Zomato\u2019s online orders. That\u2019s huge! Home delivery has always been an add-on facility for most restaurants, making customers lives easy. But today, technology has gone a step ahead and is making restaurateurs\u2019 lives easier. Working hours, traffic lights, waiting line are all getting longer; not having to go through it all\u2014especially all at once\u2014sounds like such a relief. The convenience of it all is most appealing; a few taps on the app and your food is delivered. Hassle free.\nAs a restaurant, your food delivery business is more streamlined. No more reading orders back to the customer and mishearing orders. You save time and make the process seamless and convenient for your customers. One of the most important benefits of online ordering is data. You can now study behaviour patterns of your customers which in turn will impact your food costs. Trends come and go but the love for food, and more importantly, variety in food is only growing stronger.\n\u2014"

        "content": "In every industry today, we can see women rising to the top on their own merit, making a name for themselves and carving the path for others. Fortunately, to some extent, the same can be said about the restaurant\u00a0industry as well. It is often assumed\u00a0that women don\u2019t want to work in professional kitchens because of the\u00a0demanding nature of the job, the long hours and the stress of juggling\u00a0work with\u00a0family. Well, this\u00a0clearly isn\u2019t the case anymore. From Anahita Dhondy of SodaBottleOpenerWala\u00a0to Pooja Dhingra of Le 15, women are soaring to new heights in the kitchens\u2014one dish at a time.\nWe spoke to a few fabulous women to know more about them. As a result, we stumbled upon interesting\u00a0stories about them \u2013 in the kitchen and as a boss!\nIvy & Bean\n, Delhi\nRadhika Khandelwal trained to be a chef in Australia and ran her own cafe before moving to Delhi to open the doors to a lovely cafe, Ivy & Bean. Her love for food and cooking took her to Australia to be trained as a chef. Speaking of women in the professional kitchen she muses, \u201cThings are changing, but it still isn\u2019t easy for staff to accept a female\u00a0boss. They will take time to address you as \u2018chef\u2019 and not \u2018ma\u2019am\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cIn the beginning, they don\u2019t take you seriously, but with time they see your work and understand that you mean business.\u201d\nThe Bombaykery\n, Gurgaon\nHaving a mother who was a pastry chef and with a\u00a0childhood spent in her family bakery in Mumbai, Mithali Sahani\u2019s The Bombaykery was sure to be a hit. She later trained to be a pastry chef and worked at five star kitchens as an intern, only to eventually begin her own endeavour. Mithali thinks times are changing for sure, but there still are a few problems in the industry for women like dealing with suppliers, building a team and\u2014no surprises here\u2014the male staff not wanting a woman boss.\n\u201cIn five star kitchens, women still aren\u2019t taken seriously as their male counterparts. It won\u2019t be incorrect to state it\u2019s mainly a male dominated space.\u201d\nParis Cafe\n, Kolkata\nHaving been trained at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris to become a pastry chef, Sneha Singhi turned her dream of opening her own cafe into a reality in Kolkata. She, on the other hand, has had the best experience working in Hyatt\u2019s kitchen. Her advice to young women who aspire to open their own eatery someday is to work under experienced chefs and learn as much as possible because there is no substitute to hard work.\n\u201cIn my experience, I haven\u2019t had faced any problems in a professional kitchen just because I was a girl. In fact, I was accepted wholeheartedly by the industry.\u201d\nThe Palms\n, Kolkata\nPriyadarshini always dreamt of opening her own restaurant. One which brought luxury dining and affordable dining under the same roof. Currently in its ninth year, The Palms is still going strong. She says there are preconceived notions about obstacles in the restaurant industry for women. Her tips: Be clear to your family about your career and the working hours that come with it.\n\u201cIf one is\u00a0disciplined, willing to work hard and understand that it\u2019s not a regular\u00a0job, anyone can work in a professional kitchen.\u201d\nBarley & Grapes\n, Bangalore\nMeghna Varkada, who owns and runs Barley & Grapes in Bangalore, has been a part of the restaurant industry for 16 years now. She says, women now have the exposure and education to move away from the routine of getting a degree and then a 9-5 job. For her, family\u2019s support and an understanding partner are the key to running\u00a0a restaurant without compromising on family life.\n\u201cA man is able to go out and work because he has his family back home supporting him. It\u2019s the same with women. When your family is your backbone, you can go out and accomplish anything.\u201d\nKaficko\n, Hyderabad\nStemmed out of pure love for\u00a0food and inspired from travels is Kaficko in Hyderabad. Suma Chereddi opened the place\u00a0a year and a half ago and has a pan-Asian restaurant in the works, to be opening soon. According to Suma, the restaurant industry is like any other where there aren\u2019t obstacles just for women to overcome. Her cafe has inspired home cooks and others to start their own food ventures.\n\u201cI\u2019ve\u00a0build a personal relationship with my\u00a0staff. We discuss everything together. They\u2019re like family to me and that\u2019s the kind of faith I have\u00a0in them.\u201d\nMe So Happi\n, Mumbai\nPooja Arambram\u2019s family has always been in the restaurant business and it was only natural for her to open one of her own. That\u2019s how Me So Happi happened. From bunny chow to dhansak, their menu has \u2018comfort food\u2019 written all over it. Pooja believes that a\u00a0keen eye for detail and the lady\u2019s touch they bring to the table and on to the plate is what gives women the edge in the kitchen. Having said that, most\u00a0teams in restaurants are\u00a0still mostly all-male.\n\u201cCustomers have evolved and so has food, and that has given way to many women to enter the professional kitchen.\u201d\n\u2014"

        "author": "Shakti Shetty",
        "content": "A customer, regardless of whether they\u2019re right or wrong, wants to be heard and wants to be acknowledged. As a business, when you are prompt with your responses, you are invariably showing them that you care. And caring about customers\u2019 experiences is a key aspect of hospitality. A positive review or not, by responding to them, you get to express gratitude, share your side of the story, or even apologize if needed. Customers come on to Zomato to share their experiences, and as the ones who are a part of those experiences, you get to engage with them.\nResponding to a positive review is a piece of cake. But here\u2019s a pro tip \u2013 do away with those canned responses, because customers can smell it from a mile away, and it loses the effect. Take that extra minute to personalise the message, and thank them. Little things like these go a long way in\u00a0keeping those customers coming back for more.\nNegative reviews, however, are a slightly different story. Here are a few handy tips on how to handle\u00a0them\u2026\nDon\u2019t ignore them\nOne thing you mustn\u2019t forget is that an interaction between you and the customer, about a review, draws plenty of eyeballs from other customers who are reading reviews. If you choose to ignore a negative review and respond to only positive ones, it shows you in bad light. It will look like you don\u2019t care about your customers and their feedback.\nDon\u2019t take it personally\nDon\u2019t take it personally. It isn\u2019t about you, it\u2019s about your restaurant. Someone dined at your restaurant and had a bad experience. Sit back, take a deep breath and look at it objectively. Read the review thrice if you need to, and address every single problem. The only way to get rid of any negativity is to face it. The more you let it linger, the more it\u2019s going to affect your business.\nTreat this as real-time feedback\nNegative reviews more often than not, is feedback. Particularly, when it\u2019s about service and specific experiences with food \u2013 like if a diner found something in their plate, or if their food was served cold, and the likes. As right as you may be about being extremely cautious of how food is served at your restaurant, give the benefit of doubt to the customer. Acknowledge, apologize, and ensure that feedback makes its way to your staff.\nLook at it as an opportunity\nLook at a negative review as an opportunity for conversion. When someone\u2019s complaining, they want to be heard and even pacified. And when you do address their issues, there is closure \u2013 for them, and for you. When they see your concern for them and how you value their feedback, there is a high possibility of them returning to give your restaurant another chance. Now, it\u2019s up to your staff to ensure the customer has the best experience.\n\u2014\nAll reviews are subjective opinions. You can\u2019t possibly believe that every single customer that walks into your restaurant has had an amazing time. Someone won\u2019t like the food, there will be another who didn\u2019t like the music, and another who thought the staff wasn\u2019t friendly enough. It\u2019s a given that you can\u2019t please every palate. If a customer didn\u2019t like your spaghetti alla carbonara because it wasn\u2019t spicy enough, you can respond by telling them that a carbonara isn\u2019t meant to be spicy. If they aren\u2019t convinced, it\u2019s alright. Let this one go.\nThere\u2019s another side to negative reviews as well. The kinds that aren\u2019t genuine. For most of such cases, Zomato has checks in place.\nTracks each user\u2019s activity by their ratings and reviews pattern\nAssigns a Credibility Score to users based on their activity and followership\nUsers with low credibility score have little impact of your rating\nOnly reviews by high-credibility users will appear on the popular reviews tab\nEither way, your safest bet is to respond to reviews without dwelling on them. You have a restaurant that needs to be run. Don\u2019t let the negativity take up your time and peace. You can\u2019t control what one says online, but you can salvage the situation with damage control. Since all good end things on a sweet note, here\u2019s an example of good responses to a negative as well a positive review."

        "content": "Business has been good, your best selling dishes are\u00a0selling like hot cakes (pun intended), and you\u2019re happy\u00a0with the way things are rolling. Now when it\u2019s off peak time \u2013 be it the monsoon, or when people are away on vacation, they aren\u2019t crowding your restaurant as much; or when you aren\u2019t booked out on a Friday or Saturday night, is when you pull out a few good tricks that are hidden somewhere up your sleeve. This also holds true for empty tables during lunch hour at many restaurants. Let\u2019s talk about a few key areas you could tap.\nDon\u2019t drop the mic!\nLet\u2019s say\u00a0it\u2019s a multi-cuisine family restaurant, but that shouldn\u2019t stop you from introducing new elements in\u00a0your restaurant. Something new in the restaurant will bring in curious diners. Options are plenty \u2013 from karaoke to stand-up comedy, from live music to poetry slam, there\u2019s a\u00a0wide range of small-scale events people love to attend.\u00a0Keep it light and simple so it doesn\u2019t seem forced, yet there\u2019s some buzz about the restaurant. The more you\u2019re talked about, the more diners it\u2019s going to draw. Remember, these events might bring the diners in, but you need to ensure they stay for the food.\nZomato For (Your) Business\nIntroduce offers to boost your sales. Like Happy Hours, free dessert when you\u00a0order a seafood platter, or a complimentary drink when you upload a photo of your food on Zomato \u2013 you get the idea. Even introducing happy hours might get more and more tables getting full. Make these announcements on your social media channels so you have some activity going on there as well, keeping it interactive and informative. Having said that, your database should have a healthy fill of your customers\u2019 email ids. Shoot emails to them periodically with ongoing\u00a0offers so they can avail them in time (but exercise control, lest you come across as spammy).\nBurbee\u2019s\n in Noida for instance, is using Zomato Order to promote the restaurant\u2019s home delivery business. \u201cIt\u2019s rainy season and people hardly want to step out. They want to have pakoras and such so they order from us.\u201d He also says it\u2019s important to keep these discounts lucrative and to turn something like monsoon for instance, to your advantage.\nLet\u2019s Roll That Dice!\nOne of the reasons diners come back to restaurants and cafes is engagement. There are cafes who have their corners stacked with books. There are others who have merchandise for sale. Some of them have board games to keep their diners entertained.\nNishant Sinha from \nCoffee Cup\n in Hyderabad says a cafe is something in home and office. The kind of place you\u2019d visit regularly. And when you have regulars you want to keep them coming back for more. Coffee Cup has a fun range of board games like Snakes & Ladders, Ludo, Jenga, and the likes. They also have 500 \u2013 600 books including fiction, non-fiction and comics they keep for sale. \u201cWhen customers come into the cafe and place their order, they don\u2019t wait around for their food to get to the table. Instead, they get themselves a board game and get playing\u201d.\nWith these added elements, your business is bound to increase, even if marginal. It could also work as a USP \u2013 something for people to talk about and something for people to come back for.\nSweet Deal!\nLook at what\u2019s around you \u2013 sports arenas, colleges, corporate offices, etc. Work out a partnership with them giving them the best your restaurant has to offer. And once the ball gets rolling, they are sure to turn into loyal patrons. A few examples \u2013 providing lunch combos delivered to corporate offices at a discounted price, offering discount cards or giving a beverage free for every meal to college students, giving restaurant vouchers worth a certain amount to winners in sports arenas, and the like.\nRevisiting the menu\nLastly, revisit your menu. Keep the \u2018hot cakes\u2019 aside and focus on what\u2019s not selling as much, and what\u2019s not selling at all. You have a couple of choices here \u2013 either get the non-selling ones off the menu, even temporarily, or bring in\u00a0a new specials menu for that time. It\u2019s also the best time to introduce\u00a0local seasonal produce in your menu. Sit with your chef and see how you can work around this.\u00a0Keeping non-selling dishes on the menu will only increase costs. Might as well do away with it and give diners something new and refreshing.\n\u2014\nThe slump\u00a0in business should be looked at as an opportunity to understand it better. Every restaurant goes through a lull \u2013 it could be monsoon, peak summers, peak winters, schools reopening, and many other factors that contribute to it. Find the gaps, be imaginative, and fill them with ideas that could really work like magic\u00a0for you. Keep your eyes open for what\u2019s picking up in the industry, and apply what might work for your establishment."

        "content": "\u201cIf anything is good for pounding humility into you permanently, it\u2019s the restaurant business.\u201d \u2013 Anthony Bourdain\nThere are many variables that factor in whether a restaurant is \u2018current\u2019 or not. In the same breath, we can also consider restaurants that aren\u2019t influenced with time. There are exceptions. For instance, MTR in Bangalore and Moti Mahal in Delhi are\u00a0considered to be legendary restaurants. But these are the kind of restaurants that don\u2019t compete with time. However, there are plenty who do and need help. A great product can sell itself. Ideally, yes. But today it isn\u2019t enough. A successful restaurant goes beyond food. Let\u2019s break this down.\nWhen it comes to decor, less is more\nTwo young engineers who had spent a significant amount of time in Hyderabad and Bangalore, had made a keen observation that these two cities had theme-based restaurants going for them. Rishi Singhal and Mohit Harlalka then moved to Kolkata where they opened their aircraft-themed restaurant \nFly Kouzina\n. Mohit believes a theme like this would attract customers and can be replicated in case they decide to turn it into a c\u0336h\u0336a\u0336i\u0336n\u0336 fleet of restaurants. He also says they change the menu every six months and add or alter an element in the decor every now and then to keep things fresh. Since they\u2019ve been constantly innovating, they\u2019ve had people from all over the city visit them, as opposed to being popular in only the neighbourhood. Fly Kouzina\u2019s simple yet unique decor has caught the attention of diners across the city.\nBigger flavours, smaller menu\nFive days shy of turning two, \nBasil With A Twist\n, a European restaurant in Chennai, boasts of authenticity bearing local flavours in mind. Owner Bogdan Maksimovic passionately talks about food and flavours. He says you can\u2019t have 500\u00a0dishes on the menu and have all of them be good. Different dishes require different cooking techniques and flavours, and that\u2019s why he chose to stay true to his European roots. \u201cA smaller, compact menu even with multiple cuisines means you don\u2019t have to repeat dishes, and can stay authentic.\u201d Bogdan wants to give his diners an experience through his food. Even if it\u2019s a diner\u2019s only visit, he says he wants them to have the best experience with his food and impeccable service.\nKeeping up with the rhythm\nAarthi Rao-Shetty of \nBFlat and Highnote\n in Bangalore, the 8-year-old bar and restaurant\u00a0dedicated to showcasing musical talent from across the country, says the key to finding the best\u00a0upcoming talent\u00a0is to keep an\u00a0ear to the ground. \u201cIt takes years to develop taste and set a benchmark. Once you do, it has to then be consistent,\u201d she says. She keeps a tab on current and relevant music and upcoming musicians through YouTube, SoundCloud, events, visiting other venues, sometimes even\u00a0receiving music via email. BFlat and Highnote host at least two to three live gigs a week, and Aarthi says she never compromises on quality.\nIf yours isn\u2019t a bar, it shouldn\u2019t sound like it is one in there. A diner shouldn\u2019t have to lean towards the other person at their table to converse. And if it is indeed a bar, you should be on top of your music game. People coming into a music-based bar or restaurant, come for the music.\nAre you hooked?\nXII Zodiac\n in Kolkata has a unique theme where diners are suggested dishes based on their star sign. This is quite an interesting concept given that it possibly could be one of its kind. When we asked\u00a0General Manager, Bilash, he says, \u201cPeople want different and new experiences every day. Many of us still wake up to read our horoscopes in the daily newspaper looking for something new that day.\u201d He tells us how people read reviews on Zomato about his restaurant\u2019s theme, and that in turn draws more (and frequent) diners. The menu is themed\u00a0on the same elements\u00a0as horoscopes \u2013 air, water, earth and fire.\nAnother example is Bangalore\u2019s \nChutney Chang\n, a buffet restaurant. And a buffet restaurant means plenty choice, right? Right. Except Chutney Chang went beyond the ordinary, to become one that serves the most number of dishes. 55 to 60 in this case. By adding more dishes, they simply turned that into\u00a0their USP. People flock the place,\u00a0and it is\u00a0a huge hit. Another one that comes to mind\u00a0is Bob Bob Ricard, London. They have a \u2018Press for champagne\u2019 button at every table, which has been a tremendous crowd puller and pleaser. Almost every diner\u00a0talks about it in their review. At the end of the day, whether a unique selling point works on not, is up to how you package and sell it.\nAre you being served?\nThe Great Kabab Factory\n in Noida reaps in positive reviews about their service. Manager Deepak Singh believes that a weekly refresher training sessions keep the staff on their toes\u00a0and helps them serve diners extremely well week after\u00a0week. In these training sessions, they emphasize on body language, eye contact, telephone etiquette, and\u00a0many other factors that go into creating a great dining experience. It\u2019s important for the staff to feel like they\u2019re a part of creating that experience. After all, they are the face of the restaurant. And you\u2019ve got to put a smile on them.\nThere are no guarantees in any business, let alone the restaurant one. But that doesn\u2019t mean regular innovation should slow down.\u00a0If you don\u2019t see customers returning, if you don\u2019t see good reviews, and if you don\u2019t see your business growing, it isn\u2019t\u00a0time to shut shop. It\u2019s time to take a step back, and find a way to take an innovative leap forward."

        "content": "We have a confession to make. Over the last two years, we\u2019ve been so busy with our international expansion and our manic focus on winning delivery, that we let the basic USP of our core product \u2013 search and discovery \u2013 suffer a fair bit. Our own app feels a bit outdated to us, and we\u2019re now beefing up (no pun intended!) our engineering and product teams to get our app back to being one that\u2019s delightfully enjoyable to use and explore.\nWe\u2019re starting with something our users have complained about for so long \u2013 \u201cYou know so much about me now. Why do I still see the same restaurants and recommendations as everyone else? Show me stuff you know I will like. Don\u2019t be a dumb f**king app.\u201d (Yup, users don\u2019t mince their words when they care about you so much).\nListening is a very important trait. So we\u2019ve made personalisation one of the top priorities for our product and engineering teams, and we are now working on building personalisation into various aspects of Zomato. Needless to say, we are starting with the online food ordering product, but we will very soon bring personalisation to our main search and discovery product as well.\nTo start with, we are drawing on data and behavioural patterns to personalise your ordering experience on Zomato, and making crafting your meal from all those extensive fifteen-page menus waaay easier.\nFirst, we\u2019re tackling the big question:\nWhere should I order from?\nEarlier, restaurants in the online ordering flow used to appear based on factors such as popularity, and distance from your physical location. The problem was, this made the list of restaurants static, and you\u2019d likely have to scroll endlessly to find that one place you really love ordering from. To overcome this, we\u2019ve added a layer of personalisation that helps us put the restaurants you are most likely to order from right at the top of the stack. How do we know which ones to show you first? Your search, browsing, and order history on Zomato offer some very strong indicators, such as your cuisine preferences, how much you spend on orders on an average, and what you typically order at a given time of day. The algorithm also factors in how you\u2019ve been using Zomato in general, and shows places you may not have ordered from yet, but might like to try (for example, your bookmarks).\nThis has improved our DAU \u21d2 Checkout conversion on the Order app by a whopping 2.5% \n(and made us feel like we\u2019ve been living under a rock all this while).\nAnd then, we have the bigger question:\nWhat should I order?\nWe have done two things to solve this problem.\nFirst, we simply reorganised the dishes on each menu page for a restaurant, and put the ones you are most likely to order at the top. For example, if we notice a pattern of someone consistently ordering non-vegetarian dishes, we push non-vegetarian dishes to the top of every menu page on all restaurants that person views, so there\u2019s less scrolling to get to dishes they might want to order.\nSecondly, and most importantly, we made the Recommended tab on menus super smart by putting dishes we know you are most likely to order in it. These dishes are picked on basis of your past order history, other users\u2019 order history, and corresponding order ratings received for those dishes. Our aim while designing this tab was to ensure that you are able to build an entire meal for two from that one tab, without having to swipe at all. It literally takes seconds now. I, for one, have placed my last six orders this week using just the Recommended tab. There\u2019s some simple machine learning behind these recommendations, and we hope you\u2019ll love this nifty new feature.\nAs expected, both of these changes have significantly reduced the time it takes to build an order \u2013 as of now, we\u2019re seeing orders being placed 21% quicker, and we will further improve that number.\nLike we said earlier, these are just baby steps towards making Zomato more personal and loved. We are going to get smarter, and will make up for all the work that we didn\u2019t do for you over the last couple odd years.\nThere\u2019s still a lot more to come, and we can\u2019t wait for you to see it.\n1% done."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/project-warp-fighting-bias-on-zomato/",
        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "For years, our top priority at Zomato has been to ensure that we remain a trusted resource for the millions of people who use Zomato every single day.\nAn important part of this priority is to keep biased content out of reach of our users. There are a number of automated checks, which learn and get smarter over time. In addition to that, our neutrality team ensures that we are constantly watching for new ways in which people try to game the system; this knowledge is fed back to our engineering team, which makes sure that we always stay one step ahead of business owners who write good reviews for their own business, and bad reviews for their competition.\nOver the past year or so, with the growth of popularity of Zomato as a restaurant discovery product, we\u2019ve seen a rise in the number of people creating biased content \u2013 a few agencies spread across the world are now offering services to artificially boost restaurant ratings on Zomato, and individuals are offering to write positive reviews for restaurants \u2018as a service\u2019. And business owners are happily buying into this, because of the lure of a higher rating on Zomato. For the most part, this doesn\u2019t work. When it does, it means that someone somewhere has figured out a way to get smarter than the system that we have created.\nWe are constantly working on making sure that we are smarter than the folks who want to game the ratings on Zomato to make a quick buck. Over the last few months, we have been working to completely overhaul our bias-detection algorithms. \nOn Thursday, 9th June 2016, we are rolling out a strong new anti-bias algorithm\n that will help clean up biased reviews retroactively, and also put sophisticated new bias checks in place for the future. While we can\u2019t divulge too much (for obvious reasons), we\u2019d like to highlight some of the key things that will change.\nThis is our Panda update, so to speak. Here are the details of what\u2019s changing \u2013\nLess deletions, more hiding.\n One might assume that deleting biased content from Zomato is the easiest thing to do. It is, technically, but anyone smart enough to try and game the system in the first place, will also be smart enough to identify patterns in what gets deleted and what doesn\u2019t. So from now onwards, we will be deleting fewer biased reviews (but we will still delete the obviously biased ones), and algorithmically hide such reviews where they won\u2019t be seen by most users. This will ensure that the user experience doesn\u2019t get hurt, and spammers don\u2019t have a clue.\nUser credibility scores.\n The new algorithm takes a fundamentally new approach to user credibility, and significantly increases the confidence level with which we can predict a user\u2019s bias in their reviews. The new credibility scores assigned to users increase or decrease their ability to affect the restaurant\u2019s overall rating. Credibility now factors in users\u2019 behavioural patterns on Zomato over a period of time, as well as the quality of a user\u2019s content. There\u2019s enough NLP and manually curated historical data in place for us to cluster users into various \u2018bias\u2019 categories.\nModeration history.\n For ease of explanation, we\u2019re going to use one of the oldest (and slightly more dramatic) cliches in the book \u2013 it takes many good deeds to build a good reputation, and only one bad one to lose it. What this means is, if a user has a history of having their content flagged and moderated, their ratings will automatically carry far less weightage in a restaurant\u2019s overall rating. While Zomato is an open platform where we encourage people to write honest and unbiased reviews, we take abuse and bias very seriously, and will do what it takes to keep Zomato free of it.\nRecency and decay.\n Everybody makes mistakes, and consistency is not always a given. Business owners have often complained that they still get \u201cpunished\u201d for a bad review which they received 5 years ago, and their streak over the last 2 years has been very good. Fair point. Going forward, the effect of older ratings and reviews on a restaurant\u2019s aggregate rating will taper off over time, giving users a better idea of what they could expect at a restaurant if they were to visit today.\nThose are, in a nutshell, some parts of the new anti-bias algorithm. If we tell you more, or give you more details, we\u2019d be doing a disservice to our users by disclosing more than we should to the people we are fighting to keep Zomato bias-free.\nStarting tomorrow, some restaurants may benefit from having a lot of biased, low-value content hidden from plain sight, while some may see their rating reduce due to lower ratings from (in)credible users. We hope users and restaurant partners alike will understand and appreciate that this is being done to improve the overall quality and credibility of ratings and user-generated content on Zomato for the long term.\nWe\u2019ve always told every business owner we have ever gotten in touch with \u2013 \n\u201cimprove your business, delight your customers, and the ratings will take care of themselves\u201d\n.\nHowever, since you got to this point in this post, there\u2019s one important point to remember. \nZomato ratings are not simple averages\n. You \ncannot\n calculate the average of the ratings and reviews that you get and say \u201cthis rating doesn\u2019t make sense\u201d. \nAnd then there\u2019s normalisation.\n Or classroom ranking as some people call it. For a city, we forcibly fit all restaurants and their ratings on a normal distribution curve. In short, there\u2019s a lot that goes on under the hood to make sure that you get a true sense of what you can expect.\nThere\u2019s plenty more to come that will help make Zomato an even better and more useful product. \nOver the years, we\u2019ve kept working on ways to keep the bias out, and it\u2019s something we will continue to do.\n Folks who try to beat the system will always try and find new ways to do it, so it\u2019s important that we evolve faster \u2013 and this is a strong step in that direction."

        "content": "Let\u2019s face it \u2013 some things just go really well together. Shahrukh and Kajol. Rainy days and a great book. Or Pepsi and a delicious meal. We can\u2019t really make the first two happen on demand, but for the third, we\u2019ve got it covered for you.\nWe met the Pepsi team a couple of months ago to discuss interesting ways to partner. The very first few ideas were simple and dumb \u2013 for example, we went as far as asking ourselves \u201cshould we give a free Pepsi to customers who place an order above Rs 500\u201d? We\u2019re tired of \u201cfree\u201d, so we decided that we need to dig into our creativity to find something more appealing for the user, and target a product integration towards customers who would value the product at the price it sells for. Not for free. At Zomato, we don\u2019t love people who love only free.\nFinally, we found the answer. And today, we\u2019re super excited to announce the new Pepsi integration into the Zomato app, which makes it ridiculously easy to add a Pepsi to your online orders on Zomato when you need your cola fix.\nThe next time you\u2019re ordering online on Zomato (from a restaurant that serves Pepsi, of course), you\u2019ll see the little Pepsi icon and an Add button in two places \u2013 in the \u2018Recommended\u2019 tab on online ordering menus, and inside your cart. From here, you can just go ahead and add as many bottles as you\u2019d like to order.\nFor a customer placing an order, having an easy way to add a drink from within the cart means less effort swiping to the \u2018Beverages\u2019 section, which usually sits at the very end of the menu.\nAs far as brand integration goes, this is massive for both Zomato and Pepsi. For one, the context in which the Pepsi brand is appearing couldn\u2019t be more perfect. People open Zomato when they\u2019re hungry or thirsty, and this puts the product right in front of a large, targeted audience specifically looking for things to eat and drink. Moreover, adding a drink to a food order is almost second nature \u2013 in the past month alone, with the summer at its peak, 72% of all online orders placed on Zomato included a drink.\n\u2013\nYour app will need an update for you to see this integration. If you use the Zomato app for ordering, both iOS and Android apps (download now at \nwww.zomato.com/mobile\n) already have this feature; it will be rolled out for our standalone Order apps over this week.\nIn terms of traditional advertising metrics, this integration gives an average of 40k targeted eyeballs to Pepsi everyday. And the Zomato restaurant finder apps (where this is live already), have seen a 140% increase in Pepsi orders. We\u2019ll have more concrete results to share on what this has done for us, and for Pepsi, in a few weeks\u2019 time.\nUntil then, here\u2019s to making your orders on Zomato a little bit sweeter!"

        "title": "Our Unit Economics for Food Delivery in India",
        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/our-unit-economics-for-food-delivery-in-india/",
        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "In earlier posts, we spoke about what our\n online food ordering business has taught us\n, and\n how we built the transactions DNA\n at Zomato over the past year despite having been a content-centric business so far. In this post, we will zoom in and look at the unit economics of our online ordering business in India, and how things look for us in the future.\nBefore we go on, let\u2019s show you how order volumes stack up during various times of the day, and days of the week.\nWe look at our unit economics on a monthly basis. Now, if you slice out the peak volume on Sunday, those four hours obviously have extraordinarily great unit economics. But the trick of the trade is to make your unit economics work over an entire month/week, which factors in multiple peaks and troughs.\nIn the month of May, we processed a total of ~750,000 orders, continuing to grow at an average of 30% month-on-month. We\u2019ve grown our online ordering business in a sustainable manner, focusing on high average order values, consciously avoiding the discounting route, and putting a great customer experience at the core of everything.\nOf the ~750k orders last month, 80% of the orders were fulfilled by restaurants themselves (where we don\u2019t do the delivery for them) \u2013 we call these Type A orders. 20% of the orders were fulfilled by us, through our last-mile logistics partners \u2013 we call these Type B orders. Keep this nomenclature in mind as you read on; this blog post analyses both Type A and Type B orders separately.\nHere\u2019s how everything stacks up for us.\nThe tldr; version of unit economics is in this chart below (all numbers in INR):\nNote: In an analyst call a few days ago, we had said that the loss per order for Type B orders was Rs 2. That was because until last week, we used to average out our total processing/support cost over all received orders. However, now we have now started calculating processing/support cost separately for Type A vs Type B orders, and the loss per order for Type B orders comes out to be Rs 9.1\nIf you want to know more about the thinking behind each of these numbers, and how these are calculated, please read on.\nAverage Order Value (AOV)\nAOV (sometimes also referred to as average ticket size or basket size) is the average value of an order during a period of time. AOV can be pre-discount, or post-discount, depending on how you look at it. Having said that, you can only gauge the real value of the business you are building if you consider the AOV post-discounting. Customers acquired through discounts are almost always going to be discount seekers, and not building that into your long-term unit economics means you are not being honest to yourself.\nOur AOVs (post all possible ways to consider discounting) are Rs 480 for Type A orders, and Rs 375 for Type B orders.\nZomato doesn\u2019t do much discounting by itself. Less than 2% of our orders are discounted by us, while 27% of our orders are discounted by the restaurants themselves. When restaurants discount something, we don\u2019t call it discounting, we call it \u2018pricing\u2019. Just like airlines, or hotel prices, because restaurants push discounts on Zomato themselves to drive demand, using the Zomato for Business app (which they use frequently for review notifications, etc.).\nEven this real-time pricing is built into the average order values for Zomato. Effectively, this formula is what holds true (and should hold true) if you are honest to yourself about your average order values \u2013\n(average order value) * (number of orders) = (total amount of real money transacted on the platform)\nTake-rate/Commission/Gross Margin\nThis is the percentage of the total bill amount that the restaurant pays us for bringing them the delivery orders through our online ordering service. We have a variable commission rate for most of the restaurants on our network; the commission rate depends on the delivery experience for each order as rated by the customer \u2013 the better the experience, the lower the commission. While it might seem counterintuitive to do this as against charging a flat commission rate, it incentivises restaurants to provide better experiences, which leads to better customer retention.\nFor us, this is averaging out to 8.2% in the most recent month for Type A orders, and 18.2% for Type B orders (which includes an extra 10% for delivery).\nHere\u2019s the math for this.\nType A orders, commission\n \u2013 \nAOV * Take Rate = Rs 480 * 8.2% = ~Rs 40\nType B orders, commission\n \u2013 \nAOV * Take Rate = Rs 375 * (8.2% + 10%) = ~Rs 68\nThis means that we have Rs 40 to play with for Type A orders, and Rs 68 to play with for Type B orders. That\u2019s our gross margin on each order, on an average.\nFor type A orders, we need to make sure that the total order processing cost \u2013 including payment gateway fee, order processing fee, support cost \u2013 is less than Rs 40 per order.\nFor type B orders, there\u2019s an extra cost we incur per order which is the delivery cost, and we need to make sure that the sum of order processing cost and delivery cost is less than Rs 68.\nNow, let\u2019s talk about Delivery cost.\nDelivery cost\nApplicable to us only for Type B orders, this is the cost incurred to deliver a single order. This is a loaded cost, which means it includes salaries for delivery staff, the equipment and vehicles they use, as well as training and administrative costs. We pay Rs 50 to our delivery partners per order on an average (more on that later).\nBut it costs our delivery partners Rs 62 to fulfil an order they receive from us. An important point to note here \u2013 despite our business being extremely spiky, our delivery partners (Delhivery and Grab) are able to work in a relatively cost-efficient way because they can do e-commerce and grocery deliveries during our lean times (when food ordering is not at its peak). So Rs 62 is extremely good already. There\u2019s room to make it better, and we are together working on predictive tech to make route planning better for delivery personnel so that this cost can come down to around Rs 50 per order.\nAnother important point to note \u2013 Rs 50 will eventually only be possible if you are able to keep delivery personnel busy during lean periods for food orders (which they do by serving e-commerce and grocery). Oh, and by the way, this math doesn\u2019t factor in the very high recruitment cost of delivery personnel because of sky-high attrition.\nWe are thankful to our delivery partners to work with us to grow this part of the business. If we were to do this ourselves (and we\u2019ve had the urge to do it multiple times), we would end up ruining the unit economics for the entire company in one shot. Because of the spiky nature of the business, the delivery cost would work out to ~Rs 105 per delivery. Of course, in some dense areas, during peak times, this can be much lower. But over a month, over all the markets you serve, it makes no sense at all, and you will lose more money than you can ever imagine recovering in any way possible.\nAnd we haven\u2019t yet gotten to the order processing and support costs yet, which is next.\nProcessing and Support Cost\nProcessing cost includes the telco data fee we incur when we automatically transmit a new order over to the restaurant. However, sometimes the device at the restaurant\u2019s end has a bad signal, and we have to then make an SOS call to them to get the order processed. Our network is designed to have 95% automation, but it ends at 80% automation because of data/battery issues at the restaurant\u2019s premises. Obviously, automation is way cheaper, easier, and quicker than making a call to relay an order.\nThen there\u2019s the support cost, which is what we incur when something goes wrong, and the customer raises an issue with our support team.\nFor Type A orders, we only have a two-way conversation to handle \u2013 between the customer and the restaurant. For Type B orders, we have a three-way conversation to work with \u2013 the customer, the restaurant, and the delivery partner\u2019s person who is on the road.\nOur total processing and support cost for Type A orders adds up to Rs 18.4 per order. For Type B orders, it adds up to Rs 27.4 (primarily because of the three-way calling, which adds more support agent time, and tariff to the cost stack). Three-ways aren\u2019t always a good thing.\nSix months ago, our support cost was about Rs 50 per order \u2013 we\u2019ve managed to bring this down to current levels with automation, and by making hundreds of micro improvements. There is no silver bullet to bring this cost down \u2013 you have to keep chipping away at this cost bit by bit. And that\u2019s what makes this business exciting and endless. Save a rupee per order, and the unit economics start looking way better than they did before.\nAnother thing this cost includes is the payment gateway fee, which is not borne by the restaurant separately (35% of all our orders are now paid for online). The number of restaurants accepting online payments on Zomato has gone up drastically in the past six months. In addition to a smoother product experience for customers, it also significantly drives down the cost associated with cash collections, and prevents pilferage \u2013 something that is very hard to control with a large delivery fleet, even if you own it.\nA founder of a now-defunct local grocery startup once told me that their entire net revenue got wiped out due to cash pilferage at the hands of delivery personnel. Interestingly, he wasn\u2019t taking that into account when calculating unit economics, and was adding these costs in the corporate overhead line item of \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d.\nNet Contribution Margin\nNet contribution margin = (AOV * Take Rate \u2013 Delivery Cost \u2013 Processing Cost)\nThis is what contributes towards the overall profitability of the business, and has to, over time, offset the fixed cost of the business.\nCustomer acquisition cost (CAC)\nThis is the marketing cost. This is beyond unit economics and fixed costs. How much CAC you incur, depends on how much money you are willing to spend to acquire each customer into your transaction funnel, and at what pace.\nIndia\u2019s CAC to LTV (life time value for a customer) ratios are very bad. Some companies are even acquiring a transacting user for as high as Rs 1200. Why\u2019s that so high? We pay extremely high prices to various marketing channels in addition to discounting for customer acquisition.\nAlso, most e-commerce/transaction businesses have a traffic problem. They need to spend large amounts of capital to re-engage customers i.e. getting them to transact again on the platform. On that note, the Priceline group spent $2.8bn last year on online marketing, and Amazon spent $3.8bn. Unless customers visit the platform for something else (e.g. content, reviews, photos, and sharing) and then naturally move into the transaction flow, it is very hard to drive high re-engagement rates for commerce platforms. And that\u2019s exactly what makes it easy for us at Zomato \u2013 our classifieds business, where we have 8.5 million monthly uniques in India alone. And so far, less than 3% of them are ordering from us. There\u2019s massive room to grow before we think of paying big $$$s for marketing.\nFixed Cost\nSales teams, engineering teams, analytics and business teams. This cost stays fairly the same over time if you are adequately staffed here. Over time, the total net contribution margin should become more than the fixed cost, which will give you\u2026\nProfit.\nThis might have needed explaining in 2015. Not anymore."

        "content": "We came across a Facebook post from a long-time user of Zomato who, after gaining adequate popularity and trust as a reviewer on Zomato, started offering positive reviews as a service to restaurants.\nTypically, we don\u2019t react to people who slander Zomato and claim we resort to unfair practices to make money. But we are reacting today, because we\u2019ve received calls from the media about covering this incident, and that puts everything we do to maintain the sanctity of Zomato in a bad light.\nAs they say, a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.\nWe deleted this user\u2019s profile because our neutrality team had proof that this user was resorting to unfair practices. Here are screenshots of the conversation between the user and a restaurant owner.\u00a0\nThey were sent to us by the owner of the restaurant \u2013 one of the most honest business owners we have worked with (and believe us, that isn\u2019t always the case).\nIn his post, the user is clearly telling the restaurant that he will write a positive review for the place. This means the review was going to be biased. As a result, we cannot trust any of this user\u2019s reviews, and cannot let our vast community of users read or trust any of his reviews either. With that in mind, we decided to delete Prateek\u2019s profile.\nAs we always do when removing a profile, we sent an email to Prateek, telling him why we were going to delete his profile \u2013\nDespite this, Prateek says in his Facebook post that we never informed him about his profile being deleted.\nIt pains us to see this post, mostly because of the glaring gaps and false accusations in his story. For the benefit of everyone who refers to \u2013 and trusts \u2013 reviews on Zomato, we\u2019d like to clarify a few things anyway. We\u2019ll address each point he makes in his post individually.\n\u201cA new restaurant (is about to open up or) opens up in a locality. Either it approaches Zomato, or Zomato approaches it for enlisting on the portal.\u201d\nThis is true. Restaurants pay nothing to be listed on Zomato.\n\u201cZomato\u2019s Area Sales/Marketing Manager pays the restaurant a visit. Asks the owner/manager if they\u2019d want a good rating & reviews for the restaurant since it drives business in return. Most of us do refer to Zomato to look for the \u2018best restaurants\u2019 in a particular area, so it makes sense for a restaurant to be there.\u201d\nWe have a content/data collection team that collects and lists restaurant information. If a Sales Manager visits a restaurant, it\u2019s because a new restaurant is a potential advertiser (for the banner ads you see on Zomato). The code of ethics for our sales team does not let them talk about reviews to a potential advertiser, and we maniacally enforce this policy. Even a benefit of doubt here is always given to the organisation, and not to the sales person.\n\u201cIf the restaurant owner is financially well-off, he gives in to Zomato\u2019s monopoly and pays up to get \u201cgood ratings\u201d.\nRestaurants cannot pay for a rating under any circumstances (unless, of course, they\u2019re paying users who are resorting to unfair practices). We have enough eyes and ears out there to manage the menace.\n\u201cNow, Zomato\u2019s \u201cverified reviewers\u201d (you know the ones with blue & white stars on their DPs) come into picture here. Zomato invites these guys to do review under the pretext of \u201cZomato Meetups\u201d or whatever godforsaken name. These guys eat to their heart\u2019s content for free, and subsequently reward the restaurant with high ratings and positive reviews.\u201d\nMeetups are our community engagement activities where we invite Zomato reviewers \u2013 having a Verified profile is not a prerequisite for this \u2013 for a meal at a restaurant. Yes, the restaurant hosts these meetups, and users do not pay for their meals. However, whether or not these users write reviews (let alone positive ones) is entirely up to the users themselves. It is made very clear to restaurants that this is an exposure opportunity for them among regular users, and that they are not allowed to ask for reviews.\n\u201cAlso, by the way, Zomato\u2019s uses its own (corrupt) \u201calgorithm\u201d to rate restaurants. The ratings are not simply calculated as \u201cNo. of Ratings divided by No. of Users,\u201d Zomato provides its own ratings to most restaurants (based on the deal it strikes with them.)\u201d\nA restaurant\u2019s rating is based on the ratings it gets from users. Zomato does not provide its own ratings to restaurants, because that would inherently violate the neutrality of Zomato as a platform \u2013 more on this soon. Prateek is right when he says that ratings are not absolute (# of ratings divided by # of users). Ratings on Zomato factor in the credibility and trust a user has built with us over time, and are then spread on a normalised distribution curve; you can read about it in detail here on our blog: \nhttp://blog.zomato.com/post/114022437961/simplifying-ratings-for-a-better-dining-experience\n\u201cNow, thanks to Zomato\u2019s \u201crating\u201d and credibility thanks to the reviews by Zomato Verified Reviewers, the restaurant starts attracting customers and business becomes good. Until, after a while, Zomato pays them a visit again.\u201d\nA restaurant will attract new customers if it offers a great dining experience. Simple. Zomato acts as a discovery platform for these restaurants, and reviews written by Zomato users help others decide where to eat.\n\u201cWhy did they delete my account? Because I was doing reviews independently, and not as a Zomato Verified Reviewer. Restaurants would directly invite me over for free meals (thanks to my good following on Zomato & Instagram) and I would in turn honestly review their restaurants on the Zomato app. Zomato obviously gets a whiff of it.\u201d\nAnyone is welcome to review restaurants independently. It doesn\u2019t matter whether one is a Verified reviewer or not. The problem arises when one starts offering positive reviews on Zomato as a service \u2013 which was the case here. We got to know of it because restaurants Prateek wrote to sent us screengrabs of his conversations with them, which we have attached above as proof.\n\u201cNow, since my reviewing doesn\u2019t reap any monetary benefits for Zomato, it decides to delete my account instantly without ever once notifying me. A bad example, but it\u2019s a case of a big shark eating up a smaller one to get bigger and for future profits.\u201d \nReviews definitely add value to Zomato, but we expect them to be fair and neutral for them to be useful to other users. If you are approaching restaurants offering positive reviews in exchange for free meals, that is in direct violation of our review guidelines and policies. This has got nothing to do with monetary benefits. It has got everything to do with honesty and trust.\n\u201cOn the day Zomato deleted my account, I had 6,000+ followers and 250+ reviews. It felt as if I had lost a huge part of the work I had accumulated over the last 2 years. I was an absolute Zomato lover as well as an evangelist; probably that was another reason why kept mum about this.\u201d \nDeleting a profile is something we don\u2019t love doing, especially when we know a considerable amount of effort has gone into building it. But when we know that someone is resorting to unfair means, we will do everything to maintain the sanctity and trust of the platform we have worked hard to build over the last 8 years.\n\u2013\nThat\u2019s all and more than what we have to say about this. We are a responsible platform, and will continue to be so \u2013 at any cost."

All others must bring data.\u201d \u2013 Captain Glimmergut\nA few days ago, Tony Stark was looking at a restaurant page on the Zomato app, and he exclaimed \u2013\n\u201cThere are so many buttons on this page. What do you want me to do? Should I write a review? Or upload a photo? Or should I check-in? Or mark this as been there (oh wait, have I been there)? How is that different from a\ncheck-in? This sucks. I\u2019m leaving. Jarvis, can you please figure this\nout for me?\u201d\nOur data scientist, the caped superhero, ranted \u2013\n\u201cTony, you\u2019re too used to making Jarvis do everything for you. And most things suck for you anyway. You suck too, I\u2019m way cooler than you. I feel we\nshould cut the number of actions on a restaurant page down to what\nmatters and what works. My gut tells me people do loads of check-ins\n(because it\u2019s easy, and everyone likes to show off where they\u2019re\neating), and upload lots of photos, but don\u2019t write many reviews.\nReviewing a restaurant is fucking hard. But I\u2019m being stupid. I think\nI\u2019m losing my superhero ability of using data to beat Jarvis. I\u2019m going\nto go look at the data and see what our users actually do and don\u2019t do,\nbefore I choose to do or not do something.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what our data scientist, who gave himself a new name \u2013 \u201cCaptain Glimmergut\u201d \u2013 has to say about the revelations he\u2019s had from looking at the data.\n\u201cIn the past week, 9k users checked in on Zomato, and made a total of 16k\ncheck-ins across the world. In the same week, 32k users wrote more than\n60k reviews. Whoa. That\u2019s a million reviews every four months! And we\nhaven\u2019t even started pushing our leaderboards. In the same week, 20k\nusers uploaded 170k photos. That\u2019s more valuable than f**king Jarvis!\n170k photos! I think our next target should be Pinstagram. They also\nchanged their logo to some rainbow-coloured disaster last week. I think\nwe have a good window of opportunity.\nHold on. So people write 4 times more reviews on Zomato than they check-in? And that is in spite of our marketing teams and sales teams actively working on pushing check-in campaigns. Wow. That\u2019s a lot of work for very little outcome. Maybe we should focus on what our users already do, or want to do. Like uploading beautiful photos on Zomato. To do that though, I agree that we will have to improve our photo uploads on the app, and the quality of our filters. But anyway, let\u2019s actually \npush\n photos. And reviews. Let\u2019s push stuff that actually moves stuff. F**k check-ins.\nProduct team, can you please kill check-ins from our next app update?\u201d\nProduct team \u2013 \u201cDone. We trust God, but you gave us data. Doing this for our new iOS app today, other platforms shall be done soon. We\u2019ll move all\nour users\u2019 check-ins to their \u2018been there\u2019 list along the way. High-fives\nfor giving Tony one less thing to whine about.\u201d"

        "content": "An HSBC analyst report marked down our valuation from $1b to $500m. For starters, this is very different from all the markdowns so far where investors have marked down their own investments. But given all the media reports, I got a lot of questions from people at Zomato about what\u2019s going on. Here\u2019s an email I sent to everybody at Zomato (2100 people currently across the world) to allay their concerns and answer their questions. Read on.\n\u2014-\nHello all,\nYou must have woken up today to Google Alerts with mentions of Zomato\u2019s valuation being marked down by HSBC. As you already know, the media is all over it, and we are trending on Twitter.\nSince the report isn\u2019t public, and we all get troubled by where we are and where we are heading, here\u2019s some context and detail around the HSBC report.\nOverall statements in the report\nIn the report, it clearly says \u2013 \u201cWhy do we differ from consensus?\u201d. That means that this report is an outlier, and there are enough analysts, VCs, and founders out there who have called us \u201cthe only defensible Indian unicorn\u201d, and have said \u201cthere\u2019s multiples more inherent value in Zomato\u201d about us.\nThe report claims that we have low market share. Our internal data shows that we drove a large percentage (>50%) of business to some of the biggest restaurant names in the country. Our traffic in India, our home market, also grew 8% in April 2016 over March 2016. We have over 8.5 million monthly uniques in India alone \u2013 very few Indian companies can claim that much traffic share in a single category. Also, we are currently present in 23 countries, and we are the market leaders in 18 of them.\nOur food ordering business\nIt claims that we need to heavily invest in building last mile logistics on our own, and win in the order business to defend our advertising business. Now, delivery is a small part of our advertising business. Most of our ad revenue comes from the dining out and nightlife categories. Our search and discovery business is a big funnel for our transaction businesses though. We are able to divert traffic to transactions businesses (ordering, and table reservations) without any additional customer acquisition cost \u2013 a unique advantage that cannot be contested. At present, ~3% of our monthly unique customers are ordering on Zomato, so the room for growth within our existing user base is massive.\nIt also claims that we will need to invest in our own last mile logistics to hit profitability in online food ordering. We already know that the unit economics of owning a food delivery fleet can never work out.\nTo give you a little perspective on where we are at, we hit 33,000 online orders yesterday \u2013 at our average order values, it makes us the largest player (and only profitable players on a unit economics level) by GMV (there\u2019s a blog post coming soon about our food ordering economics). We already are profitable in the order business at a unit economics level, and the overall online ordering business will hit profitability when we get to an \naverage\n of 40,000 orders a day. We should get there in the next 3-6 months. Also, there isn\u2019t any food delivery company in the world which owns its last mile logistics fleet, operates at scale, and is profitable. These assumptions and statements in the HSBC report make it look like they\u2019re coming from someone who doesn\u2019t \u2013 and hasn\u2019t bothered to \u2013 understand the space well.\nUS operations\nIt claims that the US is an overcrowded market, and we will not be able to make inroads into the US. HSBC, because it never spoke to us, doesn\u2019t know that we didn\u2019t acquire Urbanspoon for its US presence. We acquired it for Australia and Canada, and our traffic is kicking ass in these two markets. We are monetising the traffic in Australia already, and Melbourne and Sydney are already in the top 5 revenue generating cities for us across the world.\nAd sales profitability\nIt says that we will need to build sales teams in a lot of countries going forward, and it will increase costs. However, all our countries already have large sales teams, which don\u2019t need to grow any time over the next 12-14 months.\nIt says that ad sales based models in the US haven\u2019t been able to scale and grow significantly. True. But Yelp, our largest counterpart in the US, is showing extremely positive signs on great sales execution \u2013 the last quarter\u2019s results have been great, and their stock is up ~75%. On that note, we have significantly healthier margins in our ad sales business than pretty much anyone most people know. Case in point, Japanese companies \u2013 Hotpepper, Tabelog, Gurunavi are very large businesses in our space operating solely in Japan, and churn out hyper profitability in just the ad sales business. Even The Economist called our business model one with \u201cmouth watering margins\u201d in an article about us last month.\nI have more to add here. Our revenue has doubled over the past 9 months. Costs have been rationalised. Burn is down 70% from the peak \u2013 it was high because we were experimenting with various business models and geographies, which we have cut down drastically \u2013 and we are now focused on the large opportunity in front of us in our core business and core markets. We do not need to raise another round of funding to sustain the business, or steer it to profitability. The advertising model has huge headroom for growth. More than 95% of the restaurants in our core markets have yet to be monetised. Mobile, which is over 50% of our traffic, is yet to be monetised seriously \u2013 the new product which will be out before the end of the May will completely change the face of mobile app monetisation for us. Fifteen out of the eighteen countries where we are traffic leaders are yet to see serious monetisation efforts. Apart from this, there is humongous scope for growth through increase in revenue per client, and retention rates.\nOverall profitability\nThe report then goes on to say that it is unlikely we will hit profitability in our markets in the near term. But we already have, and we made an announcement when it happened. An example for you in real numbers \u2013 the Philippines. Our revenue in the Philippines is 1.5x of the total cost of the operation. When I say \u201ctotal cost of operation\u201d, I literally mean cashflow. And our Philippines team is using its profits to charge its growth going forward. We are aiming to hit overall profitability (without compromising on growth) at an overall company level in the next 6-12 months \u2013 depending on how well we execute in the near future. And we will re-invest those profits in our business to grow further, and faster.\nAlso, my thoughts on valuations \u2013 nobody who knows our business has marked down our valuations. In fact, our existing investors are bullish about us, and are willing to back us further, if needed. And they have categorically said that our valuations are justified. Especially because we are more than doubling year on year, and the next year looks even more exciting for us. But external perceptions of valuations are determined by the state of the market, and the availability of facts to the person who is analysing these numbers.\nHaving said that, we have a lot of work to do to justify the faith (not the valuation) our investors have put in us. We need to continue producing high quality work, innovate on our product, build and scale our new businesses to a point where they become meaningfully large and highly profitable contributors to our overall business.\nThe Economist in its coverage on us also says \u2013 \u201c\nIndia has surprisingly few brands that are recognised abroad\u2026.consumer marques from India ring few bells internationally. Newcomers in its ebullient startup scene are mostly focused on the 1.3 billion-strong home market. So Zomato \u2026 counts as an exception.\n\u201d\nNo pressure. There\u2019s that much more to live up to, and win.\nThere\u2019s something that we say often \u2013 \u201cwe are only 1% done\u201d. We are truly 1% done, and if we continue to focus on execution, the noise will die down very soon.\nLet\u2019s get back to work.\nDeepinder"

        "content": "We \nrecently shared\n some of our learnings from our online ordering business. This post takes a step further back, and looks at how we rewired our DNA from that of a media content/media business to that of a transactions business.\n===\nWe\u2019ve been in the content business for what feels like aeons now. And while it comes with its own unique challenges, the content business is \nquite\n different from the transactions business. The content business comes with small allowances for errors. You get more chances to experiment and make mistakes, and you can afford to take a two-day break to focus on something else if you need to, without things falling apart. The transactions business, however, is a completely different animal. If you take your eye off it for a minute, things can get out of hand \nvery\n quickly.\nMost of our transactions business had to be built from scratch, and needed a tectonic shift in how we thought about and approached our business. Moving Zomato from a predominantly content/media DNA to that of transactions was easier said than done \u2013 more so because we needed to find a way for both these parts to coexist as part of our global business and product.\nHere are the three simple (and at the same time radical) things we did to build the DNA of our transaction business, from the ground up \u2013\nWe put together a solid (and mostly new) team.\nIt\u2019s no secret \u2013 finding the right people is half the battle won. Given the razor-sharp focus and intense effort the online ordering business needs, we assembled an independent team dedicated to kickstarting and growing it. We put together a crack team of engineers, product managers, and designers to give the product shape, and used that as a foundation to build on top of.\nA few months down the line, we had \nPankaj\n, our co-founder take over the business to drive things even faster. With his deep understanding of Zomato as a product, and a data-driven approach to business, we have been able to significantly grow order volumes, improve our retention cohorts, customer support and satisfaction, as well as market the order business in a cost-effective way.\nWe built a standalone app to begin with. \nRolling out an independent app for online ordering \u2013 Zomato Order \u2013 was the first time we ever unbundled an app for a specific feature instead of integrating it into the main Zomato app. Doing this helped us quickly learn our way around an entirely new business, make the mistakes we needed to, and fix them quickly. It also meant our engineering teams could work on independent development and release cycles, which allowed us to keep testing and tweaking without having to ship heavy updates too often. Once we knew our tech for it was stable, Zomato Order became an SDK we could bake seamlessly into the main Zomato app with relatively little effort.\nWe moved the Order team to a separate floor in our office.\nWhile the end customer being served is likely the same, our Content and Transaction businesses have very specific \u2013 and distinct \u2013 things to focus on. To ensure our still-growing Transactions team wasn\u2019t distracted by any of the Content business\u2019 priorities, we separated the two teams and moved them to independent floors. In fact, they even ate lunch separately so they could continue thinking and exchanging notes about what they were working on while they ate, as our teams usually do. Bringing in and maintaining single-minded focus takes a little extra discipline, but the long-term upside is more than worth it, especially in a business with \nvery\n narrow margins for error.\n===\nToday, we\u2019re processing ~28,000 orders a day across India and UAE \u2013 our two primary focus markets for online ordering. And while our advertising business still accounts for the lion\u2019s share of our revenue, our online ordering business is rapidly gaining significant share.\nIn our next post, coming up in a few days, we look at \nThe Unit Economics of Food Delivery in India and UAE\n."

        "content": "It\u2019s been 20 years of fusion food for chef Pradip Rozario and he shows no sign of stopping yet. We sat down with him for a conversation\u00a0to learn more about his journey and what inspires him on a daily basis.\nWhat got you into cooking, and when?\nWhen I was in college, my ambition was to become a Chartered Accountant. But I ended up getting into hotel management. I was determined to make a name for myself and be the best at what I could do. After passing out of the hotel management institution, I moved to Mumbai to work with the Taj group of hotels. At the Taj, I began with butchery and then moved on to the coffee shop. Eventually, the coffee shop was closed and an Italian restaurant, Trattoria was was opened. I was sent to Italy for training. I came back and ran Trattoria as Chef de partie.\nWhy fusion, and why not specialize in any one cuisine?\nI didn\u2019t intend for fusion to be my style when I opened my first restaurant Kurry Klub. It all came about when this one gentleman who came in for lunch and asked for Bengali khichdi and fried with along with it. I served him what he\u2019d asked for but with a twist. I gave him a side of schezwan sauce as a condiment. He lapped it up and told me how he\u2019d loved it. That\u2019s when fusion happened.\nHow have you evolved as a chef?\nI started off as a trainee in butchery, and ended my 15-year tenure as the executive chef. Even after I have opened my own restaurant, I consider myself a chef and not the managing director, chairman or the owner, because I want to continue learning and evolving. And the next generation should remember me as a chef, and when I\u2019m not here they should take the legacy forward.\nWhat are the two most unusual ingredients you have cooked with and has turned out to be a hit?\nThat would be lentils and schezwan peppers. There\u2019s Italian food everywhere these days, but you can\u2019t make it spicy. By sprinkling some schezwan pepper on risotto, it gives the dish a lovely fragrance.\nYou\u2019ve been doing this for 20 years now. What inspires you to cook\u00a0every single day?\nPeople who love food inspire me. It\u2019s very important to me to make people happy. And I believe I can do that by doing something new all the time.\nTell me something about your new restaurant Mio Amore.\nMio Amore is a casual dining restaurant and the name means \u201cMy love\u201d or \u201cMy beloved.\u201d I\u2019ve been asked about the name, and it\u2019s because of love. I love the restaurant, I love my staff, and I love what I do.\nIf you were to start off all over again as a 20 year old just out of college, which restaurant would you work for, or which chef would you train under?\nI\u2019d still work with the Taj group of hotels. And the chefs I\u2019d want to work with or train under would be chef Arvind Saraswat and chef Jimmys in the UK. They are extremely innovative, disciplined and creative chefs.\nWhat is the one thing you think the restaurant industry lacks or needs to pay more attention to?\nI think hygiene. Hygiene doesn\u2019t only apply to the interiors, but also waiters, kitchen, water, bathrooms everything! There are two kinds of guests \u2013 one that will tell you openly that something or some place in the restaurant is dirty and needs to be cleaned, and the other kind that are quiet about it and don\u2019t return. That\u2019s the dangerous kind. So instead of assuming everything is clean, we must ensure the restaurant and every square inch of it is spotless and hygienic.\nWhat is 2016 looking like for you, and your restaurants?\nMy dream is to be able to serve something new everyday at my restaurant. Not with a printed menu that changes every six months or so. As of now, I\u2019m going to be traveling and attention conventions in the US and Poland and to explore the Indian food scene there. I\u2019d like the world to know more about home style Indian cuisine and would want them to cook Indian food at home as well."

        "author": "Pankaj Chaddah",
        "content": "We were primarily a content/media product company until about mid-last year, when we launched our online ordering (delivery) service. We weren\u2019t a newcomer in the space, though \u2013 back in 2005 (long before Zomato/Foodiebay was born),\n Deepinder\n (our Founder & CEO) launched what was probably India\u2019s first online food delivery site, named Foodlet.\n Our new online food ordering business has been one of our steepest learning curves. While we had learned our fair share of what to do and what not to do by observing other players in the space, most of our learning has come by\n doing\n. \nTwo million orders and many thousands of happy customers on, this post is to put forth some of our key learnings (new ones and reinforcements) from our online food ordering business.\nFocus on customer delight and cohorts \n In any business, you are only as good as your customers think you are. We hustle for every single customer\u2019s issue, and make sure that we minimise our order failure rate (orders which don\u2019t get delivered for one reason or another) \u2013 that number is well below 0.5% now. \n One truth we learned very early on is that apart from the usual stuff, there\u2019s literally\n any\n number of things can go wrong with an order despite everyone\u2019s best efforts. And it\u2019s up to\n us\n to make things right. Something we\u2019ve been doing since the very beginning in situations that hit rock-bottom with customers is to send them a care package, with a personalised handwritten note. It\u2019s a small gesture that makes a big difference.\nHey \n@ZomatoIN\n: thanks to Lakshada & team for the gracious words & care package \u2013 they\u2019ve turned me into a huge fan! \npic.twitter.com/qcYlNjDa11\nFebruary 16, 2016\nAnother thing we\u2019ve done is to make our support team very easy to access via a chat feature, built right into our app. It saves customers the hassle of making phone calls for any kind of order query or request, and helps us serve them better.\nOther companies delivering Food offer huge discount. Zomato offers brilliant post order service. I opt for later. \npic.twitter.com/jcYxc9k20X\nMarch 25, 2016\nGoing the extra mile to tell our customers we care about them has made a difference, and it shows in our customer retention rates. Over time, our cohort curves have begun to look like smiles, and the frequency of orders has also grown exponentially for returning customers. In India, the order frequency for retained customers has increased 2x from 1.5 in Jun \u201815 to 3.2 in Jan \u201916, while in the UAE, frequency has increased an even more significant 4x from 1.6 in Sep \u201915 to 5.1 in Jan \u201916.\nA low-spending customer will always be a low-spending customer\n A few weeks ago, we ran the numbers on the first-order value for a group of customers to see if we could predict the basket size for their future orders. We found that the value of the first order\n does\n define how much those customers will spend in the future \u2013 a\n staggering\n ~70% of the customers whose first order was lower than Rs. 200 have not spent more than Rs. 300 on future orders. \n This trend becomes especially relevant if you are luring customers to your platform by running offers that drive the cost of a meal below the Rs. 300 mark, and then taking on the cost of delivering the meal yourself. Customers might love it, but it\u2019s a double whammy \u2013 they end up spending less on future orders, and it hits the unit economics hard. Even if you aren\u2019t doing the last-mile delivery yourself, it\u2019s very hard to make a single penny out of an order up to Rs. 300 value. Which brings us to the next point\u2026 \nFocus on valuable volume\n The only way to counter the trend of low-value first orders is to have a large enough number of high order value restaurants that can balance out the economics. Our Average Order Value (AOV) is very high (Rs. 500 ($7.5) in India, and AED 60 ($17) in UAE), because we\u2019ve focused on partnering with a healthy mix of restaurants across the price spectrum. This way, the economics balance out if we have a small number of customers ordering a meal for one with a relatively lower AOV. \n Burning money in an unreasonable way to grow the business doesn\u2019t make sense. Agreed, competition is tough, but positive unit economics are necessary for any business to scale. Building companies on negative unit economics is an unproven concept, and has far too many disasters associated to it. \nDon\u2019t set expectations you can\u2019t sustain\n As much as you\u2019d like to, you can\u2019t promise 30-minute delivery with no-questions-asked refunds for orders below Rs. 500 \u2013 that\u2019s like trying to provide Taj-quality services at corner-sweet-shop prices. It is important \u2013 and sensible \u2013 to set very real and sustainable expectations with customers. And while some of these pain points can be solved with tech, using brute force and money to try and provide a differentiated level of service can only last as long as the money in the bank.\n We recently deployed a preliminary version of a self-learning algorithm that predicts how long it might take for a restaurant to deliver to a specific location at a certain hour. When customers in that location are browsing restaurants they can order from, we show restaurants that will deliver food to them the fastest first. This (and some other cool tech) brought our average delivery time down to 38 minutes over three months.\nAsk yourself a question \u2013 what\u2019s your unfair advantage?\n Our unfair advantage is our traffic from our search and discovery business, which we\u2019ve spent years building. It\u2019s given us a large number of users we can gradually start moving from using Zomato to just search for restaurants, to ordering from them online. This directly affects our Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), which works out to near-zero ($0.07 at the time of writing this).\nZomato users call restaurants through Zomato to place a food order 200k times every day \u2013 our aim is to convert a significant number of those to online orders relatively quickly. But the most exciting thing for us is that of the 10 million monthly active uniques in India and the UAE \u2013 the two markets where we have launched online ordering \u2013 less than 2% of them are currently ordering online on Zomato. So theoretically, there is room to grow 50x\n within\n Zomato before we need to go acquire new customers.\nMoney is never an unfair advantage unless you have orders of magnitude of it greater than your competitors. Even then, the service you provide needs to be of the highest quality, or you will get killed by the marketplace.\nThe restaurant is as important as the customer\n We approach restaurant partners with the understanding that our relationship with them will go beyond the transaction. It\u2019s straightforward \u2013 if restaurants succeed, so do we. Our classifieds business gave us very clear indicators of where the customer interest was, and how we could expect a restaurant to perform. We brought these partners on board, and work with them on an ongoing basis via dedicated account managers whose mission is to ensure that our partners grow and keep our customers happy. We increased our acceptance rates dramatically from 87% to ~95% by working proactively with restaurants to help them understand the importance of great customer experiences. \n Bringing high-potential restaurants on board has proven to be a key growth driver for us, and they are seeing the results too \u2013 as of today, over 3,000 of our partner restaurants are consistently receiving at least 30 online orders a month via Zomato. And we are just getting started.\n Most restaurants in India already use our Zomato for Business app to reply to reviews, and update information real time. We\u2019ve equipped the app with a feature which gives them the option to post deals that help them boost their order volume. This has seen great adoption from merchants \u2013 most of the offers seen on Zomato Order are posted directly by the merchants; and ~25% of all online orders on Zomato have an offer applied to them. In fact, Zomato might already have the largest number of restaurant deals and offers without creating a separate deals platform for the purpose.\nEvery day should be better than yesterday\n Of all our teams at Zomato, our order team possibly iterates the most on a daily basis. The delivery business is extremely dynamic, and the only way to stay ahead of the game is to continuously improve various things we do every day. There are various vectors in this business, and more often than not, improving something ends up compromising something else. The trick is to find the right balance which is sustainable for the business. Every 0.5% margin improvement, and 0.5% improvement in customer retention rates make a difference. And the only way to continuously improve is to never consider something as \u201cdone\u201d.\n ===\n That\u2019s about it for now. Hopefully, we should have more to share in a few months from now. Also, coming up in a couple of days \u2013 a post on how we built the transactions DNA at Zomato. It\u2019s the background story on how we pivoted our DNA (and not just the business) from that of a content business to a transactions business."

        "content": "We spoke with the chef about Nicli Antica Pizzeria, Italian food, his nickname and of course, pizza.\nTell me about the Nicli Antica Pizzeria: How was it started? What was the concept?\nBill McCaig, the owner of Nicli Antica Pizzeria, was looking for a restaurant venture and noticed a huge gap in Vancouver for some really good pizza. He chose Gastown because having such a traditional style of cooking pizza, with the woodfire ovens, and even Gastown\u2019s history, it made for a great place to open up a Neapolitan style pizzeria.\nSo, how did you personally get into Italian cooking?\nWell, it really does start with pizza. I had a small stint with artisanal pizza when I worked at Central City. I helped open that kitchen in 2003, so while I was working there I really enjoyed the pizza aspect. A few days later, I thought \u201cI like this industry, I want to do something that makes me happy,\u201d so I started looking for pizzerias. I Googled two words: \u201cWoodfire Pizza\u201d and \u201cOrganic\u201d and Rocky Mountain Flatbread came up. So I went there and asked for a job. I didn\u2019t even start on the pizza station, but once I got on that station, I loved it and excelled at it just because I wanted to do it so bad.\nDo you create the menu as well? What is the concept behind the menu?\nThe menu changes seasonally, but the thing you have to remember is it\u2019s Neapolitan pizza. There are some things I will never change, like the Margherita or the Marinara\nHow many pizzas do you have on the menu?\nWe have 9 pizzas\u2014my favorite floats between the Margherita and the Marinara still. There are people who know that there are more than just 9 pizzas here. You have to be really curious when it comes to looking at the menu. And there are some pizzas that have fallen off the menu but if you\u2019ve been coming here since day one, you can still ask for them. We don\u2019t ever promise anything but if we have the ingredients to make them for you, we will.\nWhat\u2019s the secret behind the dough and the sauce?\nThe secret behind the sauce is tomatoes and salt \u2013 and a lot people are surprised at that every time. They try our sauce and ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s in the sauce?\u201d Honestly, it\u2019s just tomatoes and salt. The secret is in the freshness and simplicity. A lot of times when you make the pizza sauce at home, you might want to cook it down so it gains flavor and aromatics, but then it loses its freshness.\nWith the dough, the secret is time. We always make it the night before, leave it to it proof and ferment overnight, then we come in in the morning and we roll it. It\u2019s only four ingredients \u00a0(water, flour, yeast, salt), whereas other pizza doughs might use oil or other ingredients. With Neapolitan dough, you just have the four ingredients and the high temperature oven, which allows for no oil. We cook the pizza so fast that it gets a little crispy on the outside but it\u2019s tender and moist on the inside\nWhat are some favorite ingredients you like to use and what makes a pizza just right for you?\nMy favorite ingredient right now is really boring, but I love sliced red onions. A good pizza for me has a simple Margherita or Bianca base, then cooked for 90 seconds. Once you get it out of the oven, you finish it with salami, some onions, and hit it with fresh arugula.\nWhat else do you love on the menu other than the pizza?\nEvery Saturday and Sunday, we feature a brunch pizza which is reminiscent of a really good omelet or a full breakfast (potatoes, bacon egg), and those are always crowd pleasers. It\u2019s fun because I do it up two ways: I either cook an egg at the front of the oven in a pan and slide it sunny side up on the pizza or when it\u2019s really busy I will crack and egg right on the pizza before it goes in. And we have tricks to make sure the egg on the pizza cooks properly, like don\u2019t put toppings where the egg is, it has to be just the dough. It\u2019s always fun as they are both very specific\u2014they\u2019re ready when they\u2019re ready. You can\u2019t tell an egg to be ready, and you can\u2019t tell a pizza to be ready; you just pray it happens at the same time. It\u2019s fun and it\u2019s also scary.\nWhat else do you make in-house? What ingredients are you most excited about?\nThere are a lot of ingredients that we make in-house. Our bacon that we even cure in-house, for sure, ricotta, peperonata, garlic confit, Italian sausage, the stock in the Pasta e Fagioli soup\u2014I could go on. [I\u2019m most excited about] local asparagus from BC because it\u2019s amazing. And strawberries, which is more of an early summer thing.\nHow often do you change the menu beside the features?\nWe\u2019re constantly tweaking; certain things you just fall in love with and become established on the menu. I like to make changes every season, depending on what comes in with the greens in the spring. I just wait to see what the local farmers are offering and bring that in as features or if they have abundance of it we can create a menu item for it.\nWe read online you have a nickname?\n[Chuckles] Bulldozer Tozer. I am not a little person; let\u2019s just say once I get going, there is a momentum like a Bulldozer."

        "content": "Chef Giorgio is constantly traveling between both restaurants where he heads lunch, dinner and dessert, all by customer request. The Zomato team recently went behind the restaurant\u2019s doors to catch up with the Chef to get a glimpse into cooking up the classic Italian dishes in a dynamic and fast-paced country like the UAE.\nHow long have you lived in Abu Dhabi?\nI have been here for three and a half years, going on four in April.\nWhere are you from?\nI am originally Italian, from Genova, the city of pesto sauce and focaccia.\nWhere were you before coming to the UAE?\nFrom Italy I went to work in London as a chef. That was a very different experience and I was so young, and I learned a lot from being there.\nHow long have you been cooking for?\nI have always been passionate about cooking; it\u2019s a part of my upbringing and lifestyle. So much so that I have been inside the kitchen since I was 14 years old \u2013 I am 28 now.\nWhat\u2019s your favourite dish to cook?\nI always love making starters, but also I love making the \nreal\n, Italian tagliatelle for those who never tried authentic Italian food before. A lot of restaurants offer this dish and a lot of people abroad have tried it, but not the true Italian\u00a0tagliatelle. That comes from ancient recipes from Italy.\nCan you tell us what your day looks like as a chef?\nI wake up very early to go pick up fresh produce and ingredients to be used during the day in our menu. Then I go to our Khalifa Park restaurant in Abu Dhabi where I prepare the daily buffet with my staff. I change the buffet every day on the basis of the fresh ingredients I could find in the morning or else people will get bored of the same thing. Just yesterday, I was deciding what dessert to make for the buffet and I came up with a completely new chocolate whipped cake. In the afternoon, I come to the Marina Square First Clique location and interact with the customers. We have a lot of regulars here and I often take requests as to what they would like to try or what they\u2019re in the mood for. At night is when I make my specials. Anything from dinners to desserts, this is where I get very hands on in my dishes. During the weekend Khalifa Park restaurant is closed so I spent all my time in Marina Square Reem island restaurant.\nAre there any food trends you have noticed that people like here in the UAE?\nEveryone loves spaghetti seafood. I would say it\u2019s our most popular dish and people always come back for it. But people also love a good old fashion Italian pizza!\nWhat\u2019s the difference, if any, from cooking in Italy and then in London and now in UAE?\nFor me, honestly, there is no big difference. I cook with passion and don\u2019t let the location hinder my creations. At the end of the day, it\u2019s all about access to ingredients and most of these ingredients can be found here, in the UAE. Once I have my ingredients, my kitchen can be anywhere."

        "content": "He began working at the age of 13, and hasn\u2019t looked back since. We sat down with \nChef Matt Dean Pettit\n to talk about food, fame and facing the dragons on CBC\u2019s hit show \nDragon\u2019s Den\n.\nGiven your success as a restaurateur, what do you look forward to the most everyday?\nThat\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s funny to say but I like seeing peoples faces when they\u2019re coming into the restaurant.\u00a0Whether they want to have the experience at Rock Lobster or perhaps want to meet me, I just like seeing people sharing, talking and laughing around food, because when I was a kid that\u2019s the reason why I started my seafood restaurant. Going out for us was really special; for my birthday my parents would usually take me out and it was a really fun time. It was always around a celebratory thing for me, but now people go out more and more, which is why we try to make our offering really affordable. At the end of the day it\u2019s nice to be approachable, it\u2019s nice to be affordable for a lot of people and that\u2019s sort of my daily motivation.\nTwo Rock Lobster restaurants, a best selling cookbook, a TV and web show and now Matty\u2019s Seafood, how do you balance it all? Have you mastered the art of juggling?\nI\u2019ve always been super busy, even when I was young. It was either school or sports. I played every sport, all throughout the year. I\u2019ve also been working since I was 13; I\u2019ve always had a job so I\u2019ve definitely learned how to multitask. The funny thing is I love to rest. I guess I\u2019ve figured it out to some degree, juggling it all. You really have to surround yourself with people who are sometimes better than you. I have a great team and a great agency that represents me \u2013 it\u2019s not just me in my corner, it\u2019s my team.\nBesides seafood, what\u2019s your favourite ingredient to cook with?\nIt\u2019s always changing. I\u2019m on a really big turmeric phase; it\u2019s the thing right now. Truthfully I\u2019m always looking for ways, both at the restaurant and at home, to balance food costs. We\u2019ve never seen food costs like this in the World right now, it\u2019s at an all-time high and it\u2019s like this for everything. As a chef and home cook, you have to figure out how to adapt. I\u2019m using a lot of chickpeas, beans and legumes, because they\u2019re like a fraction of the cost of a protein. It\u2019s all about finding a way to balance something like those ingredients into a seafood or Canadiana dish. This year it\u2019s all about pulses, similar to when quinoa was the super food a few years back.\nHow do you maintain consistency in quality, service and atmosphere with multiple restaurants?\nFrom a consistency side, it comes down to being organized with our kitchen managers and teams. Everything is portioned and everything is weighed, any successful restaurant will have a system in place and know what their food cost is every week. Consistency comes down to training and it\u2019s definitely a challenge these days with the talent pool. On one hand there are restaurants opening everyday, but on the other hand there are lots of young employees that don\u2019t have much experience, this is a trend in almost every global city.\nThere\u2019s an old saying and I like it a lot\u2026 \u201cA goal without a plan is just a wish.\u201d\nWhat were the thoughts running through your head right before you stepped out and faced the dragons?\nDefinitely scared, definitely nervous. Actually, scared not nervous. If you\u2019ve been on a set it\u2019s really hot and the lights are extremely bright, so you\u2019re looking ahead, you\u2019re sweating and you\u2019re thinking \u201cHoly cow!\u201d Once you sort of get though that, it gets easier. The dragons were cool, once you start your pitch they start asking you questions and it sort of slows down. I think with anything it has to be a two-way conversation; you have to ask questions and get them talking. Beforehand, I wanted to make sure I watched the show and went in prepared, so I learned to not cut people off while they\u2019re talking and such. I was purposely biting my lip to make sure I would let them finish before I would answer. Although I didn\u2019t get a deal, I\u2019ve had lots of success and hundreds of emails pouring in; it was definitely a great experience.\nHow did you take the feedback from Joe Mimran about the brand\u2019s packaging?\nYou know what, his comment was the only negative one we got and I knew they were going to focus on it. The one side about TV is editing, they didn\u2019t show me finish speaking when I told Joe, \u201cJust so you know, we made these at 1am last night just so we could present something for the TV show. This is just a mock up.\u201d We took the photos from the packaging on our cellphones; it was literally a sticker on the cardboard box just for the pitch. Since we shot the episode 8 months ago, we\u2019ve made changes and had a ton of success since. On our website right away you can see the difference. So did we take his advice? Yes absolutely, we took everyone\u2019s advice into consideration.\nIf you could go back and re-do your pitch at the Den, would you do or say anything differently?\nI have to be honest, I ask people questions all the time and I have a lot of mentors and surrounding people I ask for feedback, but in terms of that pitch, it went really well. It wasn\u2019t edited to make us look good, but what aired was simply a portion of the conversation. Even when we walked out, the first thing I said was \u201cwe didn\u2019t achieve our goal, but it went well.\u201d I was hoping something would come out of this and it really has. People are really in tune with the show and that\u2019s where there are so many versions all over the world. I love Dragon\u2019s Den because it\u2019s Canadian and it has given so many Canadians inspiration.\nDragon\u2019s Den is an amazing and powerful tool. \nBeing associated with the show or having the \u2018as seen on Dragons Den tag\u2019, it just brings great results.\nWere there any specific dragons you were hoping to partner with?\nI would have definitely loved to partner with Jim; of course he\u2019s amazing. Every dragon brought something to the table, Michele Romanow for example; she\u2019s young and really aggressive, really great with the digital and online retail world, so she would have been a great partner. Then look at Michael, I know him and I would have had a lot of fun working together. Joe Mimran too, literally all of them provided uniqueness, but to answer that question directly, I really would have liked to work with Jim based on his background. He even said something like \u201cI feel like you\u2019re me 30 years ago,\u201d which was really, really rad. It really meant something for him to say that, and we talked afterwards and he was a really nice gentleman.\nDo you believe it\u2019s important for chefs today to reinvent themselves or should they just stick to what they\u2019re good at?\nGreat question. You know what, I personally think that it\u2019s important to stay true to who you are and your style, but I think the only way to survive is you have to be able to get out and you have to innovate. If you don\u2019t innovate, I believe you\u2019re dead and I think you need to\u2026you need to change, you need to diversify. I love seafood and I\u2019m always going to cook with it but I think, and I hate the word \u2018\ntrends\n\u2019 \u2013 but I think the shift in some things, getting away from \u2018x\u2019 food to \u2018x\u2019 food, chefs have to be able to balance and do that.\nYou\u2019re an inspiration to many young aspiring chefs. If you had to offer them advice, something that you\u2019ve learnt in your experiences, what would that be?\nWrite a plan down on a piece of paper. Honestly, I don\u2019t write most things on a piece of paper but I write a lot of stuff in my cell phone. I write my goals, I write my plans and what I want to do, I write it all down. If you have an idea, do it. Whether you want to do it, whether it\u2019s personal or for your professional life, you have to just do it. There\u2019s no reason to not go for it. Whether its money or timing, there is always something that make it seems like it\u2019s not the right time. I started the business with very little; I personally did not have a lot of money, not enough to start a real business. So what we did is we saved our money and started doing pop-up events everywhere. If you\u2019re willing to work, you can make money. If you have a great product, people will buy that product from you and I think you just have to keep pushing.\nWatch the full clip of Chef Matt Dean Pettit on Dragon\u2019s Den \nhere\n.\nPhoto courtesy:\u00a0Brilynn Ferguson"

        "content": "Hailing from an impressive history working in \u201cother people\u2019s kitchen\u201d and honing his creativity and technique on Top Chef, Bird always leaves his customers satisfied and impressed.\nTell us how you got started in food?\nI was 15 years old and my friend got me a job at Boston Pizza. Working a line there and learning how to organize yourself and how challenging it was, [as well as] how much organization it actually takes to be a cook and to be a chef, [was how I started]. That\u2019s the only thing I have ever done since then. I worked in a ton of restaurants until I was 18, and then I started working under an actual chef. He showed me a set custard \u2013 that blew my mind, an egg that was set then he unmolded it with lady fingers. I knew at that moment I was going to be a Chef. It was so weird, but I will always remember that moment.\nWhat do you love about the restaurant industry?\nThe number of directions you can go, because they say the average career span usually lasts 8-10 years, and there are so many different routes to go in the restaurant and food industry. You can start with cooking and then get into management, owning a business, elevating your cooking into fine dining\u2026 There are so many different routes, I find that very intriguing, there are always places to grow, things to do and different experiences to have.\nDo you ever find the hours difficult?\nNo, I don\u2019t think the hours are too difficult because it\u2019s kind of what you love to do. But I\u2019m having a kid and I can definitely see the hours getting in the way of that and getting a bit difficult. But if you find what you love, it\u2019s not a job, it\u2019s just natural. I definitely find that being in the kitchen makes the day seem a lot shorter. I spend probably 15 \u2013 20 hours a week, which is nothing compared to 60 hours a week that I am used to. Owning a business is great and exciting, but my true passion is being behind a stove.\nWhat was the concept behind Fable?\nI have always worked for independent restaurants my whole life. I eventually fell into a job at the Shangri-La Hotel and that was the most corporate job I have ever had \u2013 I made good money, it was easy hours, but you really lose the creativity you have, and lot of cooking is by feel and natural. So I worked there for 3 years and after that time you kind of get lost and lose your own style of cooking because there are all these parameters. I didn\u2019t know what my style was I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do but all I knew was I hated that environment. But when I got on to Top Chef, it was so inspiring, because I had not been given that opportunity in 3 years to cook what I wanted. I have always really been concentrating on quality of product you get in, and knowing your farmers. I forgot all of this and was totally squashed down. I am completely inspired by local, seasonal ingredients that define Canadian Cuisine. I came up with the name for my restaurant [Fable] and was like \u201cI know what I want to do\u201d\nI just wanted to cook my own food. That was the only thing on my plate, that\u2019s the only vision I had for Fable\nHow do you train your staff?\nOne thing I have really learnt about reading on management\u2026 [is the] importance of having relationships with your employees and which I never realized before\u2026 I mean really establishing relationships with employees, finding out what drives and motivates them, and every employee is at a different stage [as well, but] everyone\u2019s opinion is valid, I don\u2019t see the same as [through] the employee\u2019s eyes\nWhat is your favorite dish to make and serve in the restaurant and \nh\now often have you/will you update/revise your menu?\nMy favourite dish right now [is] a risotto. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s corny or not but I really like it \u2013 it\u2019s all over a roasted squash the size of tennis balls and the risotto goes inside sitting on lettuce, very farm to table. It\u2019s beautiful. I have realized over the past three and a half years of operation it is not wise to change your menu too often. I think it\u2019s a Chef\u2019s ego to change your menu constantly, and it creates a lot of inconsistency in your cooking. I think that our food has gotten a lot better form not changing the menu so often.\nWhat is it like to have an open kitchen?\nCouldn\u2019t see it any other way. I enjoy it heavily. I love the interaction with guests, and love them being able to see what it is like to watch the whole process. It\u2019s an emotional roller coaster doing service and it\u2019s really cool, I think, for the guests to see the frustrations and the all the problems with the kitchen, it\u2019s like dinner and a show.\nWhat do you see as an upcoming trend in the Vancouver food scene?\nWe are in the midst of a peasantry Italian movement where everything is just plain, simple\u2026 Pizzas and pastas.\nWhat does your kitchen look like at home? What do you keep stocked? Do you make your own products? What is your must kept item at home?\nIt\u2019s not going to be anything too impressive but, I mean for me, the big thing about a pantry is salt like, kosher salt and lots of vinegars, white wine, red wine, balsamic and rice wine vinegars. And then late night snacks \u2013 I eat cottage cheese, a box of mixed greens. A late night salad as a snack is perfect. For junk food I like chocolate \u2013 so good, and French fries.\nHave you thought about opening another\u00a0Fable? Where would you open it? What concept would it be?\nWe have the Fable Diner opening that will be my 2nd location. It\u2019s going to be called Fable Diner and it\u2019s going to be a diner on Main and Broadway in Vancouver."

        "content": "\u201cNearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man\u2019s character, give him power.\u201d\n \u2013 Abraham Lincoln\nNo organisation can succeed without great leaders who inspire their people with their vision, their work, and their sense of responsibility. Over the last couple of years, we have grown a lot, and have had the fortune of working with some experienced folks who weren\u2019t with us since the beginning. The experiences of interviewing or working with great people have taught us a lot about organisation building, and some of our most valued learnings are around finding great leaders from outside our organisation.\nWhen interviewing experienced people for your organisation, you should focus less on their skills, but more on their constitution. Testing this is very hard \u2013 especially because you can\u2019t ask direct questions \u2013 but you should use your conversational skills to check for the other person\u2019s thoughts on the following tenets.\n1. Egos and titles are not the same. \nIf all leaders in a hyper-growth startup perform well, chances are that the organisation will grow faster than some of them. An organisation is always bigger than any of its people, and some way down the line, some of your leaders will be replaced by someone else who is more capable of performing that role at that point in time. During these times, the leaders being replaced can either be strong, or can act weak. The strong roll up their sleeves, get back to action and demonstrate accountability wherever required. The weak become disillusioned, refuse to grow, and hold back the organisation. More often than not, the strong grow quickly to find themselves stronger and more capable of taking on bigger roles in a very short period of time.\nIn a growing startup \u2013 as in any startup \u2013 titles and job descriptions exist only to communicate what you are on the hook for.\n2. Everything is a new challenge.\nWe have some brilliant leaders at Zomato across our 46 offices around the globe \u2013 they have impressive credentials and an equal amount of promise. But we have noticed that even if someone has been extremely successful in a similar role before, it doesn\u2019t mean that that person will be successful in the prevalent circumstances in the new organisation. For example, having led a team to do big things in a market such as the US doesn\u2019t count for much when someone tries to do it in India. The context, the market, the people, the talent, the motivators \u2013 everything is different. And quite often, someone\u2019s apparent success could also be more a function of the people they\u2019ve managed and the circumstances they led a team in, rather than their actual ability to adapt and lead a team or business in a vastly different environment.\nPrecedents of great outcomes are good to have, but remember, the characters may not have affected the outcomes.\n3. Maniacal sense of accountability. \nWhen you report to someone who checks in on you a couple of times a week, there is always a security blanket on top of your work, because you know someone more senior and experienced (and likely better at your job than you) will look at your work before it gets \u2018shipped\u2019. That thin, invisible security blanket is the root cause of any lack of accountability that creeps into some people. Leaders don\u2019t have that security blanket. They are completely responsible for a large part of the engine, and they are the last stop to ensure that their part of the engine keeps running and doesn\u2019t bring the ship down.\nBack in 2010, someone I highly respect told me \u2013 \u201cAnything that goes wrong at Zomato is your fault. Because at some point of time in the past, you could have done something to fix it\u201d.\n4. The need for ruthless prioritisation.\nWhen you are in a leadership position, and responsible for a business and the people you are leading in it \u2013 there is \noften\n no distinction between your personal life and your professional one. While you are going to have clearly defined personal and professional responsibilities, separating your life into these two lists invariably results in one taking a toll on the other. Leaders can\u2019t make one a bigger priority than the other. On one hand, there is a family; on the other hand, there are hundreds of employees. You have to find a way to balance a single list of priorities and juggle the future \u2013 you can\u2019t manage the future. Don\u2019t, even for one second, think that this is easy to do. It is chaos, and is an extremely difficult art to master, but some people find a way to make it happen. The first line of \nthe Sith Code\n sums this up \u2013 \npeace is a lie; there is only passion\n.\n\u2013\nThis is the credo we hold our leaders to as we work towards building the organisation we want to build. This is, of course, not the complete list, but definitely top of our priorities. We are doing everything we do for the first time, and we try to learn as much as we can as we go along. If you have anything to add to this, would love to hear from you \u2013 I am at \nd@zomato.com"

        "content": "Thanks for all the love for our \nLessons from 2015\n post a few days ago. There\u2019s one more thing I have to share, and I had it saved for a separate post. It demands that much attention, and would have been lost amongst all the other points in the previous post.\nHere\u2019s some context before we dig deeper into this. Almost half of our people are in teams outside of India. We are the market leaders in 18 of the 23 countries we are in, and getting to this point wasn\u2019t easy. I can\u2019t even start counting the number of personal sacrifices our people have had to make to get us there.\nWe operate in many countries that are culturally very diverse. Lifestyles, motivations, communication \u2013 all of these work differently from the perspective of each country. We made sure we were being sensitive to the local work culture, and built Zomato in these markets around such sensitivities. Some of our countries succeeded, some didn\u2019t. Some succeeded because of the product and in spite of the team, and some because of the team and not because of the product. Our most significant markets are the ones where we have a stellar team, and the product has found widespread acceptance.\nOne thing that stood out for us was that there are some countries that are culturally accustomed to working hard. And then there are some that simply aren\u2019t. We\u2019d also notice a very vibrant startup ecosystem in the former.\nPeople in some countries are very open to candid feedback and confrontational conversations. Not in the others.\nPeople in some countries are very open to constant change. Not in the others.\nPeople in some countries are generally frugal with their lifestyles. Not in the others.\nPeople in some countries push boundaries all the time. Not in the others.\nOne of our biggest learnings in 2015 is that all of the things I said above are wrong. You can\u2019t generalise anything for any country. If you are an organisation and have built a certain kind of culture, you can always find people in any country who will want to be a part of what you are building. You just have to look hard enough. And look beyond the first few people who will tell you that it simply cannot be done. You \nhave\n to be a place that\u2019s more than a paycheck for people. We made six-day work weeks possible in the UK, in Australia, and in Europe \u2013 all markets where we were told that this cannot be done. It just came down to finding a set of the few passionate people who \nwanted\n to make Zomato the biggest priority in their lives, and are happy doing it.\nThere might be an \u2018accepted\u2019 way of \nrunning\n a business in a country, but there is only one way to \nbuild\n a business anywhere in the world \u2013 find talented people who aren\u2019t afraid to work hard, and give them a space to live and grow together. When you are still building an organisation \u2013 just as we are \u2013 \ndon\u2019t be defensive about your culture\n. Wear it proudly on your sleeve, ignore the naysayers, and find people who have the same DNA as yours. They are everywhere, just hard to find."

        "content": "\u201cThe rear-view mirror is always clearer than the windshield\u201d \n\u2013 Warren Buffet\n2015 was truly our year of learning. We learned while doing things we had been doing for a while, and we learned while venturing into uncharted, unfamiliar territory. At the turn of the year, as we always do, we paused to take stock of what we\u2019d learned from the year gone by. Here are our key takeaways from 2015 \u2013\nDon\u2019t scale too fast.\nWe scaled massively in 2015, starting with acquiring Urbanspoon, which gave us a canvas 3x larger than we had before. We were rapidly launching operations in new geographies and setting up new businesses. Suddenly having that many new competitors in new markets meant\n everything\n had to become an equal priority. When you do that, you spread yourself thinner than you want to, and end up losing focus on what matters and what works.\nDon\u2019t pick a fight with everyone.\nOne of the outcomes of scaling rapidly was new competition, and we soon found ourselves at the centre of a battle against everyone around us.\nEntering new markets and business verticals either means taking deeply entrenched competitors head-on, or building something from the ground up by trying to change established user behaviour. These can both be very costly things to attempt, so again \u2013 pick your battles.\nNever take your eye off the revenue.\nEven if you have enough money in the bank, you have to make sure the money keeps flowing in steadily. Find ways to maximise your existing revenue channels, or find ways to create new ones. Also, cost saved is revenue earned, so cutting down burn by being prudent matters a lot. Rapid growth almost always translates to an extraordinary cost base, and it\u2019s always better to keep burn in check rather than beginning to feel the chill of a cold winter. Build a business that can go for a long drive, not just from one gas station to the next (aka funding).\nYou can only improve what you can measure.\nIt\u2019s as simple as it is obvious. If you can\u2019t measure the outcome of the effort (or money) you\u2019re putting into something, you\u2019re shooting in the dark. This is especially relevant if you\u2019re in the transactions business \u2013 you can either keep throwing money or people at a problem you\u2019re not sure you\u2019re actually solving, or you can keep testing, tweaking, and measuring to see what works and what doesn\u2019t. It means iterating and executing quickly, until you find the recipe for the secret sauce that tastes just right.\nTough times don\u2019t last, tough people do.\nNobody ever sets out to do anything with the intention to fail. But sometimes, achieving success means having to take tough calls \u2013 about your business, and your people. It\u2019s easier said, but if you know it\u2019s the right thing to do, bite the bullet and do what needs to be done. This is especially applicable to people, because great talent can only take you so far. You can\u2019t build a great organisation with people who are unwilling to put in the hours or effort. Even if it means hurting your short-term targets (like revenue or traffic), you should never hesitate to hit reset button and start afresh with the right folks. And if you\u2019re doing that, remember \u2013 tough times don\u2019t last, tough people do.\nCulture belongs to everyone in the organisation.\nOver time, everything decays. Your code base, your marketing brilliance, and your culture. Everything needs to be pulled up every now and then to bring it back to the standard you want your team to uphold. When it comes to culture, a few free radicals cannot ensure that the culture is strong and seamless across the organisation. Everybody has to contribute towards building and sustaining a strong culture. We didn\u2019t drive this message hard enough in the first half of 2015. Combined with a very rapid growth in our team size, the culture at Zomato took a hit. However, the efforts we have put in over the past few months have brought it all back, close to where we want it to be. Rebuilding your organisation\u2019s culture is not at all easy to do, so you should try not to get to that place anyway. \nLearn from others; don\u2019t reinvent the wheel.\nThere are tons of insanely smart people out there with knowledge, experience, and insight that you can learn a \nlot\n from. Sir Alex Ferguson, in his book \nLeading\n (a highly recommended read), lists Listening, Watching and Reading as three of the most underrated but most important things you can do. Be observant, listen intently, and soak up everything \u2013 it costs nothing. This also applies to how you are going about building an organisation. Big companies that have been around for a while do things a certain way for some very solid reasons. Understand what they do, change or discard what doesn\u2019t fit your organisation\u2019s DNA, and implement what makes sense. \nThat\u2019s all for now. Until next year."

        "content": "Chef Hidekazu Tojo opened his restaurant, Tojo\u2019s in 1988 after working as a chef in various restaurants. We sat down with him to know more about him, his zeal for Japanese cuisine and much more.\nTell us a bit about why you started a life in the world of food. Also, why do you love this industry and where did you get your breakthrough?\nMy mom used to cook but my dad only ate chicken sometimes, so when I had free time I would cook for my family. I came here in 1971 and there were no sushi restaurants back then. There was an old \u2018Japanese\u2019 town near Hastings and Powell by Main Street. I worked in a restaurant there called Maneki. Then in 1988, on Broadway, I opened Tojo\u2019s and there were no Asian customers because sushi was just about becoming more popular.\nHow has sushi changed in Vancouver?\nSushi is now very popular. Back then, I had to make sushi that people here would like so I created the inside-out roll \u2013 California and BC Roll. People started to come often and they saw me prepare the raw fish and started to like it. There is a big problem with diabetes in North America and the Japanese diet is very clean and healthy, and people see that. Now my rolls are made everywhere, but I make sure to have the quality.\nWhile Chef Tojo agrees that sushi has made a monumental shift from its traditional roots, he also agrees that the Japanese style of cuisine can be molded to incorporate new and exciting ingredients.\nWhat is your inspiration? People? What drives the creativity with your food?\nPeople don\u2019t inspire me. New ingredients inspire me. I went to Hawaii and other places and I have always gone to farmer\u2019s markets to see an ingredient I haven\u2019t seen before. Of course, I try everything, and make something from it. I get very excited when I get to try and create dishes with new ingredients.\nWhat ingredient are you most excited about to work with this year?\nThis year, we went to Arctic and tried Greenland shrimp. They are small and delicious. I will reach out to get the product from local suppliers because I want to serve it here.\nWhat surprised you the most about the food in that region?\nI had a little bit of seal and caribou which was very plain tasting and without seasoning. If I lived in the Arctic, I would probably like it because it is good meat but I live in a Western country and I would prefer more seasoning.\nWhat is the crowning moment of your career?\nI think when famous people like Pink Floyd, Paul Simon, Steven Tyler and Bon Jovi come to try my food, because they come from so far. 65% of the rich and famous people visiting Vancouver come here. It is because I create specials everyday that show the local flavour. My food is always high end and I know everything about it.\nWith over 40 years experience in the restaurant industry, Chef Tojo not only sticks to his roots in his own kitchen but works with young and aspiring chefs to help develop their careers.\nWhat advice do you have for aspiring sushi chefs?\nEach chef should offer their originality, use local ingredients, local seafood and local produce. Use 50% local and the other 50%, make it your own style.\nWhat are you most excited about 2016?\nNext spring chefs from Denmark are coming because sushi is getting popular there as well. They have heard about me and I will judge five or six chefs in a competition, here in Vancouver.\nWhat is your area of focus this year?\nI would like to get more ingredients. People who come from out of town want to eat Pacific Northwest products, and they have been coming to Tojo\u2019s for a long time because I use local and Japanese. I will be using fugu, which is a Japanese blowfish, and is popular in the wintertime as well as king crab because there are many different types. They are a delicacy. People in today\u2019s market are looking for seasonal fish \u2013 yellowtail, spot prawns, and ocean eels are just a few I cook with. With today\u2019s technology being so good, you can get fresh fish, have it vacuumed it and add oxygen in the water and ship to Canada so it ends up being super fresh.\nWhat is your favorite thing to make? To eat?\nSushi, because you can never get tired of it. Sushi is always different. I have people come three times a week, sometimes more. If it is fresh and local, you can never be tired of sushi!"

        "content": "\u201cLife can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.\u201d \n\u2013 S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard\u00a0\nLooking back, 2015 was one of our biggest and busiest years yet \u2013 expansion into new markets, new businesses, and hyper-growth across the board. We had our fair share of ups and downs over the year, but we\u2019ve learned something important from each one. Here\u2019s a look at the highlights of the year gone by, and what we have planned for 2016. \u00a0\nWe started off the year on a high note by welcoming two new members into the Zomato family \u2013 Urbanspoon, which marked our entry into Australia, Canada, and United States, and Mekanist, which saw us become the single largest restaurant search and discovery service in Turkey. In February, we launched Zomato Cashless in Dubai, to enable seamless in-app cashless payments at restaurants. Eight months later, we \nrolled back\n the product, having learned that we\u2019ll need to rework it before it can see the kind of user adoption we want.\u00a0\nA couple of months on, we launched our most anticipated service yet \u2013 online food ordering. The business has taken off very well in India and UAE and we might already be the market leaders in some of the cities we have launched in. We will be focusing on growing the business across the key markets we offer it in (India, UAE, the Philippines), and ensuring that we do it in a sustainable manner. We had our biggest learning here in the last few hours of 2015 \u2013 we decided to keep the service active on New Year\u2019s Eve, but the massive number of orders brought our servers down for a while and forced us to switch it off. Not the best note to end the year on, but it will prepare us better for the future.\n2015 was also a big growth year for us on the B2B front. We introduced three new products that would help restaurants do more with their business, and create better dining experiences for their customers. Earlier in the year, we had Zomato Book (a table management and reservation system) and Zomato Base (a point-of-sale system for restaurants), for which we laid the groundwork when NexTable and MaplePOS joined forces with us. In the second half of the year, we launched \nZomato Whitelabel\n, to enable restaurants to bridge the gap between themselves and their customers with custom-branded native mobile apps. Book is already being used by more than 500 restaurants globally, and in the past two months, 2.3 million guests were seated at restaurants using our system. Whitelabel has also been growing steadily, and more than 150 restaurants already have their customised apps on app stores. We\u2019ve been testing Base with a few partners, and the finished product is nearly ready to be rolled out and into restaurants soon.\u00a0\n\u2013\u00a0\nGoing into 2016, we\u2019ve made our mission statement \u2013 \nNever Have a Bad Meal\n \u2013 our core focus. What we envision when we say Never Have a Bad Meal, is a world where everyone is empowered enough to have the best dining experience possible. We\u2019ve been building the foundation to achieve this over the years \u2013 first, by providing all the information one needs to make a dining decision, and then by giving users and restaurants a way to share and receive feedback through reviews. The mission will soon extend to transactions \u2013 home delivery, and your in-restaurant dining experience as well.\u00a0\nAnother focus area for us this year is making Zomato abuse-free. We often come across needless hate and non-constructive rants in reviews, which helps nobody \u2013 restaurants have no idea what they need to improve on, and people reading the review do not get a clear picture of what to expect at the restaurant. We aren\u2019t suggesting that people shouldn\u2019t write about a not-so-great experience they might have had at a restaurant, but we will be taking proactive steps to keep the unnecessary rants at bay. This applies equally to restaurants, who sometimes try to artificially inflate their ratings by soliciting reviews, or trash competitors with bad ratings and reviews. There is a lot of work to be done on these fronts, and we will be doubling our efforts to ensure Zomato is clean, and more importantly, useful to everyone using it.\u00a0\n\u2013\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a lot on our plates for 2016, and we\u2019re excited about everything that\u2019s planned for this year. On behalf of the team, a big thank you to everyone who\u2019s helped get us to where we are. Please keep us on our toes by giving us feedback on what we can do better \u2013 just like you always have.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s to a delicious year ahead!"

        "content": "A couple of days ago, we \nwrote\n about a marketing campaign we were running on porn sites. We were pretty pleased with it, because it checked all the boxes of a successful growth hack \u2013 the ads got us lots of eyeballs, millions of clicks, a bump up in online orders, and all at a \nridiculously\n low cost.\u00a0\nThe response to the campaign was largely positive. People said we were ballsy for trying this at all, and that we broke new ground for doing this in a country where porn has long been a touchy topic. But there were a few things said that we simply couldn\u2019t ignore. Some folks got offended by the campaign, felt the campaign was in poor taste, and it wasn\u2019t something they expected from a brand of our standard. Some also said that all porn is not legal, and by advertising on porn websites, we are financially supporting abuse \u2013 certainly something we don\u2019t want to do. Ever.\u00a0\nOver the past almost eight years now, we\u2019ve worked really hard to build what we\u2019ve built. And while we\u2019ll be the first ones to admit that we aren\u2019t even close to perfect, we can confidently say we\u2019ve always stood for doing what\u2019s good and what\u2019s right. We\u2019ve focused on instilling the right values in our people \u2013 values we live by every day \u2013 and built our own unique culture along the way. We feel honoured when we\u2019re told that we\u2019ve set an example for young companies in India to go take over the world, by doing what we do and proving the naysayers wrong. In short, we have a lot to live up to.\u00a0\nLike we said earlier, this campaign was almost textbook \u2018startup\u2019 marketing. But we\u2019ve probably reached a stage where it\u2019s fair to expect that even if we\u2019re doing what we need to do, we do it in ways that are more \u2018grown up\u2019. We understand that we owe it to ourselves, and to those who\u2019ve helped get us to where we are, to set the right examples and convey the right messages. That isn\u2019t to say that we\u2019ll crawl into a shell and stop doing what\u2019s needed. There will be growth hacks and marketing campaigns, and they may or may not be everybody\u2019s cup of tea. But we will also be more mindful of the boundaries we\u2019re playing inside.\u00a0\nFor a start, we\u2019re killing the porn site campaign, because we sense we crossed the fine line between marketing irreverence and cultural insensitivity. If we did, and ended up offending or disrespecting anyone in any way at all, we are sorry. That obviously wasn\u2019t the intention, and we\u2019ll work on doing things better in the future.\u00a0\nTo paraphrase Travis over at Uber \u2013 \nas you get to a place where people perceive you as the big guy or the man, you have to approach things differently. We\u2019re not there yet. We want to be there and we\u2019re going to get better.\n\u00a0\nAnd we will."

        "content": "The first thing you try and work out before you start a marketing campaign is whether the ROI is going to be worth it. Specific to the online ordering business, there are a dozen ways to spend money to try and convert intent into a transaction. Discounting is a route that will get you conversions, but it won\u2019t get you a great deal of customer loyalty, and your business soon starts looking like this:\nWorking off that industry wisdom, we\u2019re constantly trying to find new ways to reach the people we want to deliver our one simple message to \u2013 order food online on Zomato.\nWe were talking about how to tap into the already buzzing late-night delivery space, and started looking at innovative marketing opportunity areas. Highly optimised Adwords, Facebook, and Twitter ad campaigns are commoditised and therefore quite expensive. The alternative seemed almost obvious when someone said \u2018Hey we should try advertising on porn sites\u2019, and then justified it with \u2018look, people watch porn, and people get hungry, so stop judging me.\u2019\nIt was an idea worth looking into at the very least, so we did. As it turns out:\nIndia ranks #5 in terms of most daily visitors to Pornhub (the world\u2019s biggest porn site network)\nOutside of Google, Facebook, Yahoo, and e-commerce sites, Xvideos is one of India\u2019s top visited sites\nThe average time spent on the site by Indians is ~8 minutes (yes, really, just 8 minutes #quickgunmurugan)\nSo we advertised on porn sites.\nApart from this being the first time we got to visit adult websites for official work purposes (you know, for \u2018research\u2019), or legitimately have a folder labelled \u2018Porn\u2019 \nsitting on\n our desktops, this was a fun exercise. We \ngot down\n to work in two teams \u2013 one would set up our accounts on Traffic Junky and Traffic Factory (the ad networks serving the top porn sites), while our creative team did all the \nhard \nwork of making our display ads (cue hushed voices, sniggering, many high-fives, and some jokes too naughty to publish) \u2013\nThe goal was clear \u2013 get people to click. Our strategy for this was fairly straightforward, too \u2013 create something that\u2019ll take people\u2019s eyes off the video, they\u2019ll click the banner because they\u2019re (obviously) getting hungry now, and then they\u2019ll order online on Zomato. The easiest part was creating ads that didn\u2019t look like all other ads on porn sites, because most ads on porn sites are for\u2026wait for it\u2026more porn!\nWe ran these ads on desktop and mobile sites, between 11 pm and 4 am \u2013 when late-night delivery restaurants are at their busiest (we have a fair idea what people who order food that late at night have been doing to work up an appetite). These ads appeared on video landing pages, just to the right of the video window:\nA week into advertising on some of the internet\u2019s naughtiest pages, here are some statistics and insights from our little experiment.\nAdvertising on porn sites costs very little money, and is significantly cheaper than other platforms. Like, \nsignificantly\n cheaper. Just look at these numbers:\nPeople in Delhi NCR clicked on these banners the most on desktops, at an average click-through rate (CTR) of 0.12% while Bangalore came (*teehee*) a close second with an average CTR of 0.11%. The campaign average CTR so far is at 0.22%.\nAt a more granular level, the highest number of clicks in Delhi came from around the Hauz Khas area. We can\u2019t say for sure why that happened, but IIT-Delhi is in the area, so\u2026\u00a0\u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\u00a0\nIn Bangalore, Koramangala was hands down the naughtiest part of town, while in Mumbai, Powai gets down and dirty the most.\nThe \nBBW/Big Beautiful Wraps ad\n was our best performing desktop ad (no surprises there); the \n\u201cHot Sticky Mess\u201d\n and \n\u201cHot Singles\u201d\n ads also did really well.\nTurns out advertising on a porn site is a great idea if ridiculously low CPCs turn you on. These are pretty awesome numbers by any standard, and we\u2019re quite pleased with the number of clicks and app installs driven by these ads so far. Are these installs going to convert to orders? We\u2019ll keep you posted on how many people skip going back to Sunny Leone, and choose to go down on a Big Beautiful Wrap instead.\nFootnote: Some folks have pointed out that Eat24 did something similar. Well, great minds\u2026"

        "content": "Touted as one of the best chefs in the world, \nManish Mehrotra\n has played a pivotal role in giving modern Indian cuisine the respect and the platform that it always deserved.\nRestoring its well deserved spot on the culinary map, he has created delicacies at the \nIndian Accent\n restaurant in New Delhi, that has astonished and left many master chefs from around the world mesmerized. Though he started his career with Pan-Asian cuisine, he soon found the way back to his roots. As we delve deeper, Chef Manish talks about the reasons behind the popularity of Modern Indian cuisine and going back to simple recipes.\nYou started with Pan-Asian cuisine and have now become one of the pioneers of Modern Indian cuisine. How did the shift happen?\nI was always surrounded by food. So, going to a Hotel Management school was a conscious career decision. I attended different classes but found cooking to be the most innovative one. I saw it as a field where you could do something on your own without having to follow a certain set of standards and that\u2019s how I decided to join the kitchen. And this how I ended up in my first job at Thai Pavilion, Mumbai. But no matter where I worked, my association with Indian food continued. In the restaurant we would cook the menu specific food but for the staff we would cook Indian food. After working with Taj, I moved to London and worked in a Pan-Asian restaurant and worked on that cuisine with a modern twist. The concept of the restaurant was such that involved fusing South Indian flavours, Chettinad, to be precise. That is when I started cooking Indian food for a restaurant. Post that Indian Accent was decided to be opened in Delhi. I asked for a chance to work on the menu and do the trials. I did it, they really liked it and here we are.\nHow would you define Indian food? \nIndian food should fulfill your senses. The Indian food comprises of different elements that can satisfy all your senses. Though the one place where we lack is visual appeal. Even if we go back in time, we had never paid that much attention on visual appeal. The Ustads, Nawabs and Khansamas made beautiful food but visually they were not that innovative. Instead of putting saffron or coriander or chillies, ginger julian, red coloured oil, or a dollop of cream; nobody thought that it can be presented a lot more beautifully. When the food comes to you in 10 different bowls, half of them look like brown coloured gravy and the other half looks like red coloured gravy. The way gravy was done, all the main ingredients were always hidden under the curry. And thus, the image of India being a \u2018curry nation\u2019 was created. All the chefs now, who are trying to experiment with this kind of food, they are now trying to change that.\nDo you think molecular gastronomy has dissolved or may be diluted the essence of Indian food?\nMolecular cooking is a kind of a technique. I would not say it has done any harm. It has not done anything wrong to any of the cuisines that it is being used in, be it Thai, Spanish, European, Mexican; and now it has also become a part of Indian cuisine. It is a new thing that becomes a surprise factor when the food is served to you. Rather than adding more to the flavour of the dish, it enhances the experience of the dish and there is nothing wrong in that. Now chefs and restaurants are going beyond that. They play with your mind. You are sitting in a small dining hall, say a seafood restaurant, with big television screens around you playing visuals of sea creatures \u2013 they are playing with your senses, which is fine. End of the day, you will come to my restaurant again, if my food is tasty and you crave for it. You will come here for the experience once. Food is always a hero. Taste and flavour are always the hero. And that is why people go again and again to a restaurant. People would not return to a restaurant for the ambience and the theatrics of it.\nMolecular Gastronomy\u00a0is a new thing that becomes a surprise factor when the food is served to you. Rather than adding more to the flavour of the dish, it enhances the experience of the dish and there is nothing wrong in that.\nWhat do you think is the reason behind paying more emphasis on the simplicity of the dish?\nThere is a difference between a made-up beauty and a natural beauty. Made-up beauty is when you garnish a dish and claim to put as many spices and ingredients in it. But making a simple thing is ten times more difficult. Simple beauty is something without a paraphernalia and is ten times more difficult to create, there the real magic of any person, chef or artist come forth and it is hence appreciated.\nWhen we talk about your recipes, how many of those are inspirations and how many are innovations?\nAlmost every dish is an inspiration. From here, my day to day life, my childhood, marketplace, some other chef\u2019s creation or some other chef\u2019s book\u2019s creation. One will always continue to learn. There is no end to it. Even the greatest chef in the world can\u2019t say that \u2018I have learnt everything\u2019, because it is not possible. Things are improving. Knowledge and information is being updated day by day. Kitchen is also one such thing where you can\u2019t learn everything in one lifetime. It will always be a learning for me as well.\nIf we talk about Indian Accent, why do you think people would come to a fine dining restaurant for a dish like khichdi (a preparation made with rice and lentils)?\nBecause Indians have stopped eating Khichdi at home. Given the hectic lives in big cities like Delhi, where they are not living with their family or working long hours, they end up eating food that is either packed, is a take-away or can be cooked in the microwave under five minutes. A phenomenon, though still not as prevalent in India, but is increasing by the day. This lifestyle is one of the reasons why applications that allow you to order online or get groceries delivered at your doorstep are doing well. It will soon happen when people go to a restaurant to savour a bitter gourd dish. All these things will become a novelty. Simple dishes, like khichdi, are an integral part of the Indian cuisine and it can be done in a beautiful manner with different combinations and it can work in a good restaurant. We have khichdi on my menu with a smoked German sausage, fried in mustard oil for achari (pickled) taste and served with it. It is a beautiful combination for a slightly upmarket comfort food.\nIt will soon happen when people go to a restaurant to savour a bitter gourd dish. All these things will become a novelty. Simple dishes, like khichdi, are an integral part of the Indian cuisine and it can be done in a beautiful manner with different combinations and it can work in a good restaurant.\nWith respect to India and Indian cooking, do you think it has become a centre of attraction somewhere as international chefs are not only recognizing but are also now opening restaurants here?\nIndia is a big country and a big market. The spending power of the people has increased and the economy is escalating and only doing better by the day. Therefore, it from a business point of view, it makes sense for international chefs to come to India. But I would say, that it is still a little far for international chefs to come to India and become successful, and let\u2019s not include franchises in this.The restaurants that were opened by a number of international chefs might not have become success stories but it doesn\u2019t mean that they did not have good food. They are fantastic. But the question that remains is, Is it there for the masses to go? Is it for everyone? I am not too sure about that.\nA\u00a0restaurant like Sarvana Bhawan that ventured into the international market and have become successful because they filled the gap for Indians who would crave for Indian food. If we talk about another league, \nChef Atul Kochhar\n, \nChef Vineet Bhatia\n, \nChef Vivek Singh\n, \nChef Cyrus Todiwala\n, \nChef Floyd Cardoz\n, they have been there in the international market since the 90s. All these chefs have done phenomenal work and have done great service to Indian food and cuisine. They have broken the barriers in a sphere and at a time when it was completely captured by Bangladeshi restaurants.\nTalking about opening a restaurant in NYC \u2013 what is exotic for us, may not be exotic for them. How do you plan to bridge that gap and create a niche?\nThat is the biggest challenge for us and we are paying complete attention to that. In fact, we are planning our menu in a way to cater and tackle it in the best way possible. We need to maintain a balance and we are putting in a lot of effort to manage that. I am going to keep our Haji Ali Custard Apple Cream on the menu. Despite their familiarity with the custard apple, it will be a unique Indian dish for my customers in New York. Vegetables like kathal (jackfruit) and arbi (taro root) are sweet and flavourful for them. Hence, these are the things that I am going to experiment with and serve it to my customer base there. Things that are completely Indian, really exotic for them but also are as palate friendly."

        "content": "There are a number of reality television shows about cooking that have taken the prime-time slots. Not only have they become popular but have also become a platform for talented home cooks to don a chef\u2019s hat and be known in kitchens and homes around the world.\nWhile many of those contestants have continued to live their dream of becoming pioneers in the culinary world, some of them have stuck to their original jobs while continuing to pursue their passion on the side. But the questions that pertain are \u2013 is the show about just five minutes of fame, does it add to the repertoire of the participants or does it act as a launching pad? To understand this, we spoke to Emma Dean, winner of MasterChef Season Six and Callum Hann, the winner of MasterChef All Star. Being the winners of one of the most popular reality TV shows in the world, they chatted with us about their own personal journeys and life after the cameras were switched off.\n\u201cI operate Sprout Cooking School with my colleague Themis Chryssidis who is a dietitian. Naturally this means our classes teach people about fresh, seasonal and healthy food in a 100% hands on environment. It\u2019s pretty much my dream job!\u201d says Callum. \u201cWhen I\u2019m not at Sprout I work with the social enterprise Thankyou in their product development team, host the food tourism segment of Chanel 7s SA Life and am the ambassador for the Adelaide Produce Market.\u201d Perhaps unsurprisingly, cooking appears to be a recurring theme for these ex-contestants: \u201cI have been incredibly busy working on content for cooking demonstrations, cooking schools (online too), as well as the occasional catering event. I am focusing on growing your own food and using seasonal ingredients,\u201d says Emma.\nTaste of time\nBut let\u2019s rewind. Given the grueling tasks, the show appears to really help in honing one\u2019s skills and turn regular home cooks into chefs. \u201cBeing on the show was like doing a research PhD on food. We spent long days on set, so I used my time to read as much as I could. When I could, I would practice new techniques. I did find though it was that the skills that I already had before the show got me through to the end,\u201d says Emma. While the show gives them a platform, achieving and surviving it become their claim to fame, but does it remain constant? Only a few of the contestants continue to appear on the show, others have retained their attachment to the culinary world but have been pursuing different things professionally. \u201cI suppose everyone is a bit different, and reality shows are a window into what the profession is but the hospitality game isn\u2019t for everyone. It gives people the opportunity to see in a (relatively) low risk environment if food is something to pursue as a career or just enjoy as a hobby,\u201d says Callum, who adds that despite being a winner, he doesn\u2019t see himself as a chef. \u201cI\u2019m very much a home cook and I think other home cooks can relate to the style of food I cook. We use easy to find ingredients and equipment most people already have at home to make it as approachable as possible.\u201d\nI suppose everyone is a bit different, and reality shows are a window into what the profession is but the hospitality game isn\u2019t for everyone. It gives people the opportunity to see in a (relatively) low risk environment if food is something to pursue as a career or just enjoy as a hobby.\nThe \u201creal\u201d food dream\nBeing on the show gave them the media attention that became a nudge for pursuing their respective careers. If it wasn\u2019t for that, would they have continued to pursue their food dream if have not made it to the top 25? \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say because you can only truly act on the cards you\u2019ve been dealt,\u201d says Callum. \u201cMy first job at 14 was in a bakery and shortly after I worked at a restaurant as a kitchen hand so it\u2019s always something I\u2019ve enjoyed. I\u2019ve had some amazing opportunities that I never would have had otherwise so it has certainly helped.\u201d Emma seems to echo the sentiment, \u201cMasterChef has given me a fantastic platform to pursue my passion for food. I have always been passionate about sustainable food and the health of our planet. I also love feeding people and making people happy,\u201d she says. \u201cSo yes \u2013 I would have continued my passion with this dedication,\u201d she adds.\nExpectations and reality\nGreat skills also come with great responsibility. Once you are noticed by the world, the biggest challenge becomes living up to the image and your reputation, satisfying people who have high expectations of you. \u201cI put pretty high expectations on myself, especially when it comes to running a business. It was an incredibly steep learning curve establishing a new business. I had to get my head around accounting, web design and development, employing people, as well as keeping room in my brain to be creative! It is worth it though \u2013 I feel like have learnt so much and am ready for the next jump!,\u201d says Emma. Callum shares, \u201cIt\u2019s a great leg up but with it does come with a few difficulties.\u201d"

        "content": "Pastry Chef at \nMarque\n (Surry Hills, NSW, Australia) by Mark Best, \nLauren Eldridge\n won the Josephine Pignolet Young Chef of the Year for 2015.\nConsidered to be one of the most prestigious award in the culinary world, it was given to a pastry chef for the first time. Eldridge, 25, has worked for Best for the past three years, and has been part of summits organized to celebrate some of the best female chefs in the industry. Achieving so much at such a young age, we spoke to her about her inspiration, being a lady chef in a male-dominated kitchen and the divide between the pastry and the savoury.\nWhat has fueled your creativity?\nI have been cooking professionally for about five years. After school, one often thinks that you need to go to a University and get a degree. I decided to be a chef \u2013 and the best one that I can be. So once I made my mind, everything just fell into place.\nCooking comes to me naturally. My food is inspired from the produce that I see around me. I don\u2019t like to work with too many ingredients but I try my best to come up with techniques that make it better. You don\u2019t have to be extravagant to make something amazing. If we take the example of a stone fruit, it would be just as beautiful to taste as it is naturally, so that\u2019s sort of where it starts. I take a lot of inspiration from my boss, Mark Best. He has mentored me for the last three years which has not only been amazing but influential as well.\nDid you ever think it was risky honing your skills to be p\u00e2tissi\u00e8\nre in such a massive industry? Or was there a fall back option?\nWhen I first started, I had a plan B but I never intended to take it. I am passionate about pastry and desserts and that\u2019s what I love, so I don\u2019t feel obliged to do more, to not beat up. There is no plan B. This is it. If I do this, I have to work hard and do it well. I could have decided to do anything, this is what I have picked and I am going to make it work.\nBeing a such a young chef in the kitchen, how do you make your stand in an otherwise dominating male and skillful set-up?\nBeing a young female has its set-backs. Women are a minority in the kitchen. People don\u2019t take me seriously often. But they learn to not underestimate me. My boss is very respectful and I am the head chef. Kitchens work in a hierarchy. If they don\u2019t listen, then they don\u2019t stay. It is very much about respect as well. I think you have to be very head strong. And you have to believe in what you are doing and in yourself.\nKitchens work in a hierarchy. If they don\u2019t listen, then they don\u2019t stay.\nThis is a very male dominated field. It is a very intense environment with long hours. I think people believe that if you have family, you can\u2019t do it. Women are considered to be very emotional. You can\u2019t be overly emotional in a kitchen when you have to get your job done. So we get stereotyped. A chef is a chef, there is no female word for it. If you do your job well then it doesn\u2019t matter. When you work hard in the kitchen, it is not about being one of the boys. I just have to be myself and they need to learn to respect that.\nIn the kitchen, is there a divide between the savoury and the pastry?\nIn restaurants, there is often a divide between the pastry and savoury. Personally, I feel that the gap is closing. When you look at patisserie around the world, there are some chefs that are given the highest accolades. Another thing is that most people fear pastry and think that this is really difficult. Programs like MasterChef helps in getting some respect for pastry chefs. I often get this: \u201cOh you are not a real chef\u201d. I say no no, I am a chef. It is how you handle it. The fact that I was awarded shows that the gap is closing.\nGiven that you have achieved success at a such a young age, are you encouraging younger talent to do the same?\nIf people ask, I am happy to assist and help them. The most important thing for young chefs (so strange to call them that, since I myself am young) is that you need to be really enthusiastic, you really need to put your foot down in the kitchen. People will help you, they will train you, that\u2019s the nature of being in hospitality. For Chefs, that\u2019s our nature, we want to help people. We want to teach them.\nChef Lauren Eldridge was in New Delhi as a part of the Creative Services Support Group (CSSG) initiative."

        "content": "A number of \nfood\n \ntrucks\n can now be seen parked on Dubai streets. Not only to meet the growing appetite quite fashionably but also to deal with the city\u2019s growing demand to eat out. While it might seem like an easy drive-by, it requires a meticulous plan given factors like the mobile kitchen, unpredictable footfall and keeping up with quick service.\nTo get a better look under the hood, we spoke to \nfood\n \ntruck\n businesses Calle Tacos, Yumtingz and Roundup that is in Association with 54 East, a \nFood\n and Beverage Global Enterprise.\nPop-up popularity\nWith new \nfood\n \ntrucks\n hitting the streets every month, it is reported that the \nfood\n \ntruck\n culture is only expected to grow more with time. As the government and regulators have come out in support, they have also made the entire process much easier. \u201cStreet \nfood\n is a corner stone of every culture and it is finally the perfect time to introduce it in the UAE. The \nfood\n regulations are in place and the residence are ready to embrace this new trend,\u201d says Dana Al Sharif, Operations Manager of Calle Tacos. Adding to this perspective, Pascal Zion Moser, owner of the Yumtingz \nfood\n \ntruck\n says, \u201cI love the fact that more and more \nfood\n \ntrucks\n are coming up in Dubai. I just hope that they stay \u2018homegrown\u2019 and cool and not turn commercial because the whole idea of a \nfood\n \ntruck\n is to have that experience of street \nfood\n served that is made by the owner and his/her team.\u201d\nThis is how they roll\nThe recipe for launching a \nfood\n\u2013\ntruck\n business involves the right amount of doability topped with inspiration. To dig deeper, we asked what goes behind planning a menu for a \nfood\n \ntruck\n, from pre-launch to daily ingredients, changes or additions. \u201cIt is about customer expectations, the local culture, the suppliers, event hours allotted and the seasonality of ingredients,\u201d says Dana Al Sharif. Pascal, on the other hand, says the \nfood\n he grew up with became a part of the menu. \u201cFor me it was about heart. The type of \nfood\n I grew up eating with and adding a twist to it \u2013 things like my mother\u2019s roasted vegetable dinner turned into a salad. The changes and additions are governed by experiences of events and being able to cater better to the different demographics but always sticking to our guns and taste.\u201d\nOne of the most important things of the \nfood\n \ntruck\n business is maintaining quality and consistency given that you are mostly on the road and away from the source. \u201cWe take our quality standards very seriously and work closely with the chefs and cooks daily to make sure we maintain the same \nfood\n experience to all our customers all the time. This includes always evolving our menu and supplier list to include the best/freshest quality available in the market,\u201d says Dana. \u201cBeing in a \nfood\n \ntruck\n, it is harder to maintain due to changing weather and temperatures as well as items being transported more. However quality is always there if you care about and take care of your products,\u201d shares Pascal.\nUnlike restaurant establishments, a \nfood\n \ntruck\n is always on the go. Thus, it is important to get the right \u2018parking spot\u2019 to be able to get maximum footfall. \u201cLocation is probably the most important factor in the success or failure of a \nfood\n \ntruck\n. With the start of the outdoor season we are being faced with this decision every weekend as multiple events run weekly in a metropolitan city like Dubai. The factors that are involved in choosing the location are footfall, actual location, surrounding environment, and of course and back ground of the location visitors,\u201d says Dana.\nBasically, the unpredictability of the footfall, lease and the share model it therefore becomes difficult to anticipate and aim for a profit margin. \u201cIt is very difficult to set the margin or change prices, we also do not want to compromise our quality or brand so we come to each event with nearly the same prices and serve our quality \nfood\n, this can hurt sometimes depending on the revenue share or fee asked for but we value our quality and brand over the profit margin and we believe if we do so customers will return and we will remain successful,\u201d says Pascal.\nFueling the \nfood\n \ntrucks\nBefore starting off the business there are few concerns that each owner expresses. Be it licensing or permits, registration to health and safety inspections, a slew of processes must be followed to meet the requirements. Kris Haggie is the senior director of Consultancy and Head of the \nFood\n \nTruck\n Division at ROUNDUP that works in Association with 54 East, a \nFood\n and Beverage Global Enterprise. \u201cWe are a one-stop-shop for all mobile businesses including \nfood\n \ntrucks\n which are main stream.\u201d Given the popularity of the business and consumers\u2019 demand for it, he attributes the growing number to \u201cthe country (UAE) having highest number of events and festivities compared elsewhere worldwide that also entices creative in cuisines for all thus allowing optimal levels of business.\u201d\nWhen deciding where the \nfood\n \ntruck\n will be set up at, the things that matter are the cuisine and the brand itself. Each \nfood\n \ntruck\n caters to a different demographic and thus the area which enables them to adapt to the same, making it high versatile and low risk.\nThey not only help in simplifying the process but also in tracking the progress of the businesses. \u201cRoundup has a constant media support to make sure that the footfall is at its highest with transparent exposure. We have an app that assists the owners to do just that. The footfall can easily be tracked at different events through it via ticketing or otherwise historical data, media coverage etc,\u201d he says. Though, where the \nfood\u00a0\ntruck\n is parked at and what cuisine is served matters as well. \u201cWhen deciding where the \nfood\n \ntruck\n will be set up at, the things that matter are the cuisine and the brand itself. Each \nfood\n \ntruck\n caters to a different demographic and thus the area which enables them to adapt to the same, making it high versatile and low risk.\u201d\nCatching up\nMost of the \nfood\n\u2013\ntruck\n businesses are extremely active on social media platforms as it helps them to connect with their customers on a real-time basis and keep them aware about their whereabouts. \u201cSocial media is important for us as it lets our customers know where we are. We only use Instagram but its more to showcase our brand and share quality images of our projects and create a relationship with the public and our staff,\u201d says Pascal.\n\u201cAs a SMB, social media plays a major part in our communication with our customers. It is also the best way to get feedback from our customers. In restaurants, customer service is a very important part of the equation and social media allows us to have open bi-directional communication with our visitors,\u201d concludes Dana."

        "author": "kanika",
        "content": "As more and more restaurants are now catering to popular choices, one can safely say that while the demographic of disposable income is expanding, so is the understanding of the preferred palate. Many young people have moved on from their traditional jobs and have opened restaurants further adding to the concept of \u2018for the people, by the people\u2019.\nDriven by their own demand for a specific food, these second-career restaurateurs are not only successful but also have found a way to hit the right spot to lure in a good footfall.\nTo identify the inspiration, understand the amalgamation and the creativity behind the curation, we spoke to an engineer, an interior designer, a lawyer and someone from a management background who now live a second life as restaurateurs.\nCatering to the appetite\nWhile doing his engineering in Australia, Vikas Narula (36) would always binge on burgers. Having lived away from home for more than 20 years, he travelled from Australia to Aurangabad to Mumbai, and was exposed to various varieties of food. Bringing the experience and exposure together, it was time to materialise an old plan of opening a restaurant with his brother-in-law Girjashanker Vohra. Depot 29, located in Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhi is an American Mexican restaurant with a menu that has been curated by the Italian Diva Ritu Dalmia and is known for its live music shows.\n\u201cWe used to always talk of having a place that would break the monotony and have the best of both worlds. While food is taken care of by Ritu, the music set-up is taken care of by Girjashanker, I am on the floor, trying to run the show,\u201d laughs Vikas who shares that Girjashanker is a music engineer and a BAFTA Nominee.\nIt was a similar story for Sidhant Lamba (31), who brought his passion for coastal food and tasteful interiors together at Amreli, New Delhi. Located in Hotel Diplomat, owned by his family, Sidhant calls this a comeback. \u201cI come from a food family and I am an interior designer. When your first profession combines with your second, you want your first profession to reflect in your second profession as well. Once I decided to do a restaurant, I wanted everyone to see the array of the way I design.\u201d\nTalking about the inspiration behind the menu, curated with the help of Chef Sabyasachi Gorai, he says, \u201cFor the first year, we were doing coastal and tandoor, all-day breakfast and comfort European food. For the new menu we have decided to go coastal food from South India, and I introduced comfort Indian food instead of western-European. It is kind of typical of what you want but with a twist to it. The reason I brought these foods because I love it too. You can only sell something if you believe in it.\u201d\nNot having access to good Kerala cuisine is what inspired Thomas Fenn (27) and Zachariah Jacob (28) to open a restaurant, in New Delhi that serves authentic Malayali cuisine \u2013 Mahabelly, which is located at DLF Mall, Saket. \u201cWe both have been in Delhi since 2006. Been born and brought up in Kerala, we would often look for the specific cuisine but were never satisfied with the options available. It was the lack of supply that pushed us to come up with this theme. We wanted to make this mainstream so that people know that there is something beyond idli-dosa. The menu consists of home-recipes that have been curated by Thomas\u2019s sister,\u201d says Zachariah who after passing out from St Stephens College was working as a lawyer.\n\u201cWe were quite sure of what we wanted to do. We were also hopeful that someone might do this instead of us going through the trouble of doing it. Every person that we have met and spoken to about Malayali food and they have only raved about it. So we knew from a palate stand-point, it is not going to be something that is incredibly difficult to sell. People will eat this,\u201d says Thomas, who was Manager, Operations at Stellar Children\u2019s Museum.\nCharging through the challenges \nThough it may seem like an easy task, opening a restaurant not only requires excessive planning but also the will to make it through tough times. From the right location to licensing; starting out with enough funds and sustaining yourself without breaking even with the investment, there are various challenges that one faces.\u201cThe thing with taking a space with the mall is that you are in a contract for three years. Even if I am bleeding money, I have to stay for the next three years. If I went to Mehrchand Market or Hauz Khas Village, if things weren\u2019t working out for me, I could give a notice and leave in the next two months,\u201d says Thomas. \u201cWhat worked for us is that we acquired an existing restaurant and retained the furniture, kitchen which not only made the transition simpler but we also avoided starting from scratch. For ideation we resorted to Google,\u201d he laughs.\nZachariah adds, \u201cThere are various everyday issues related to maintenance, man-power and kitchen. Everyday is a challenge, but when a customer tells you that he had a meal of his life, that does it for you. More so, from a desk job to have 20-25 people working for you and generating jobs and income, that also is a factor that keeps us going.\u201d\n\u201cI could write a book if I had to talk about the challenges that one faces while opening a restaurant,\u201d says Sidhant. \u201cSome of the hurdles are quite typical \u2013 to have someone as good as Saby to design your menu, but for the person to know what you want. To get your point across. The licensing and the legalities involved. No matter how difficult it was, we made sure that there were no gaps. Typically a restaurant owner would have a designer who would do everything, but in my case it was extra work. It is not an easy establishment to run.\u201d He adds, \u201cIf you open an establishment you need to constantly change to survive so that people want to keep coming back to you. If it is a restaurant, then you can never compromise on food. It has to be a priority. Decor and ambience are the important factors which surround it.\u201d\nIf you open an establishment you need to constantly change to survive so that people want to keep coming back to you. If it is a restaurant, then you can never compromise on food.\nVikas believes that if one stays true to their theme, it will work well with the customers, but that too comes with a cost. \u201cRitu does not compromise on the quality of the ingredients, irrespective of how expensive they are. The quality of the food is most important. Similarly, when we organise shows, we respect the artists who perform here. If they do not want food to be served during performances, we don\u2019t do that. It does affect the business flow and cost, but these are certain things that one cannot cut corners at.\u201d He further adds, \u201cOpening the place in Safdarjung was a conscious effort. Though Girja and I are here most of the time, the restaurant should be well within half-an-hour reach from our home if there is a crisis. Being physically present to overlook the operations makes a lot of difference. Starting a restaurant will never be easy given the challenges involved but you have to take it with a pinch of habanero.\u201d"

But what has come after has thrown him under the global spotlight.\nAn unassuming little terrace building in a Melbourne suburb that housed his second restaurant \u2013 Vue De Monde \u2013 quickly picked up a cult following, and was spurred along by an obsession with classical cuisine and a reputation for edginess and attention to detail.\nFast forward to 2015 and \nVue de Monde\n is considered to be an Australian crown jewel.

Shannon has been joined by a world class team \u2013 both his Executive Chef Stephen Nairn and Head Chef Justin James have had careers dotted with Michelin stars, and together they form a formidable lineup.\nShannon chatted with Zomato about what Vue de Monde means to him, how his team deals with the ups and downs of widespread success, and his philosophy on chasing awards.\nDining at Vue de Monde for some people is considered a highlight of their year; sometimes even their lives \u2013 there are many people who fondly remember \u201cthat time they got a chance to go.\u201d How do you continually provide an elevated experience to all your guests?\nWe always strive to search for ingredients that tell a story on our plate \u2013 the focus being Melbourne. This process and concept entails searching for ingredients that are not available to the regular home cook. I am a strong believer of the fact that a restaurant has to be aspirational not only in terms of the food served but also in terms of the decor, service, plates and all the other things that make dining out a memorable experience.Detailing is imperative. While preparing a menu, the things that need to be kept in mind are maintaining a fine balance and using great local ingredients. I am inspired by local stories and often use their relevance, so that the menu reflects the sense of the city.\nSince opening your doors you\u2019ve won countless awards and accolades. What has been the secret recipe behind this massive success? What is that one big change that you would attribute this success to?\nThe restaurant continues to evolve around what I perceive to be \u2018important to an experience\u2019. It becomes evolutionary as I change. All the aspects here are a reflection of myself and my tastes. What I like to eat, how I like to dine and other similar things. I then ensure, that they are executed in the best possible way, to the best of our abilities and simply hope that people love what we do.\nThe restaurant continues to evolve around what I perceive to be \u2018important to an experience\u2019. It becomes evolutionary as I change. All the aspects here are a reflection of myself and my tastes.\nYou\u2019ve mostly had positive press, but you\u2019ve also experienced the inevitable negativity from critics, most recently with Good Food Guide dropping your third hat. Can you describe what that roller-coaster feels like, and how do you and your team respond to criticism in the industry?\nChanging the staff marks an important reconstruction of the kitchen. More so, when it is about changing the Head Chef. It is a tough but exciting time. Our previous chef Cory Campbell did a great job but we have had a transition plan in place for two years. Both Stephen Nairn and Justin James have immense talent with massive breath of experience and great credentials. The new menu and various other changes are definitely for the better and it is an ongoing process. I have always maintained a philosophy of never chasing awards \u2013 those are purely incidental. I am focussed on pleasing the guests and making them want to return.\nMany MasterChef viewers were excited to see you on the show as a guest judge. How does the world of reality TV compare to the pressures of the real kitchen? Now that there are more and more reality cooking shows being conceptualized, do you anticipate it affecting the industry in any way?\nIt has already affected the industry in ways that are both good and bad. Overall it has a very positive effect, I think. It helps promote our industry which has a flow on effect to growers, wine makers etc. which is an important aspect of growth. It also helps attract talent to the hospitality sector. I can only ever speak for MasterChef \u2013 I can tell you every aspect is very real. One thing is for sure, when in the real kitchen, the pressure there is certainly greater!\nThere\u2019s a growing consumer push towards more sustainably sourced ingredients and food in Australia. Has this shaped your approach in any way?\nI would like to say that we were at the forefront of this. We have our own farm, use Mark Eather for ninety percent of our seafood, make our own natural chemicals through eWater and the list grows onwards from there. We have been following these practices for over a decade now and are very proud of being able to sustain it in the best possible manner.\nWhat\u2019s your personal philosophy on food?\nLess is more and using only the best ingredients.\nCan you give us a taste of what we\u2019ll be seeing from Shannon and Vue de Monde in the future?\nA new multi million dollar entry, a new menu direction with more focus on Australian cultural history. Stephen and Justin have already hit their straps, so it is going to be an incredibly exciting ride from here on."

        "content": "Chef Tom Lawson is the co-owner and the Head Chef at Rafters in Sheffield, England. At the age of 23, he has many accolades to his credit including the 30 under 30 Acorn Award (2015) and Youngest Chef of the Year award by the Craft Guild (2014).\nThere is a lot on his plate as he dons the chef\u2019s hat and also looks at the operational side. To get an overall understanding of all the nuances, right from cost to menu design and demand and supply dynamics.\nWhat are the things that a newly opened restaurant should keep in mind?\nThe biggest thing that a restaurant needs to keep in mind is its target audience. Is there a real demand for what you want to offer? You can follow a current food trend with your menu but you need to identify if there is longevity in that. What\u2019s trendy doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it will stay relevant for a sustainable period of time. Trends are often fueled by customer choices \u2013 which can be sticky or fleeting. If you feel you can\u2019t sustain the current trend then try to see if you can re-invent it to give your customers something else that they would want. Also, always take into consideration the competitive landscape \u2013 two Italian restaurants next to each other is not the most wise decision. Stick to the skill but change the location for better business.\nHow can restaurants maintain cost efficiency with respect to demand and supply?\nMicro management usually works best in this department. If its a lean day of business and your staff requirements are low, you need to order less food. If you are getting too busy that you are capping out every day, then put your prices up. You can increase turnover on fewer covers and then build the trade back up. We were full every Sunday and not charging a full GBP on roast beef. Instead, we put our prices up and lost 30% of our customers. We were taking the same money for less work. Then, once we built that trade up we were taking an additional 30% turnover whenever there was demand and people would pay for it.\nHow important is it to adopt simple techniques over complex cooking?\nEvery technique is important in its own way, but the thing that matters most is flavour. If the technique makes the ingredient really shine, then it doesn\u2019t matter if its simple or complex, provided its cost efficient \u2013 after all, not everyone can afford a centrifuge in their kitchen!\nEvery technique is important in its own way, but the thing that matters most is flavour. If the technique makes the ingredient really shine, then it doesn\u2019t matter if its simple or complex, provided its cost efficient \u2013 after all, not everyone can afford a centrifuge in their kitchen!\nWhy is it important to innovate the menu?\nCustomers tire of predictability. Yes, there will be some that will find comfort in familiarity and return for the same dish \u2013 but those customers are few and far between. Majority of customers want to see new things on the menu; however, this doesn\u2019t mean that you can be random with your menu \u2013 it still needs to have a well thought through flow and structure.\nDo you think there is a gastronomical shift happening for both customers as well as chefs?\nYes, the way people want to eat food is changing. They now expect some form of theatre at the table \u2013 things that they cannot achieve at home. With readily available good quality microwave meals filling the shelves of supermarkets it is allowing customers to think that they can just recreate what you get in a restaurant at home for a fraction of the price. So you have to be ahead of the game with it. Still give people an experience that exceeds what they can do themselves. There is also an influx of casual fine dining that is sweeping the country. Maybe fine dining is the wrong phrase because to me that is all encompassing \u2013 the table cloth, the napkins, the service and much more. What is important is the quality of the food and the consistency. That is the reason customers return.\nHow does customer relationship building help boost a restaurant business?\nIt helps build a restaurant business because you gain the customer\u2019s trust which allows then to influence others through positive word-of-mouth. We look after our regular customers. If there is something they want that is not on the menu we will cook it for them. There is very little room for ego in this industry. Only a handful can have that, but look at the history of chefs \u2013 they either close their doors because people no longer want what they offer or they diversify what they are offering .\nHow would you summarize the current food trend in Europe?\nThere has been an upturn in restaurants serving food of a very high standard in a much more relaxed environment. The other thing I have seen is chefs cooking the food they want to cook because it reflects their personality on a plate. However, I often wonder \u2013 How sustainable is that? How many people can you get to trust you? Do customers really want a choice when they eat out?"

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "We launched our Cashless product in Dubai earlier this year to enable seamless in-app payments at restaurants. Eight months on, we\u2019ve decided to shut down the business due to a lack of product-market fit in its current form. While our users loved the seamless experience Cashless provided at their favourite restaurants, we believe the product could be far better \u2013 for merchants and users alike \u2013 while also being commercially viable. Here are some reasons the business didn\u2019t take off, and our most important learnings for the future:\nUsing Cashless wasn\u2019t a part of the natural user flow for a typical Zomato user.\n We had to lure the user to think differently \u2013 this was the most difficult part. In our Cashless product, we needed a user to think about the payment at a restaurant \nbefore\n the start of the meal, whereas they are accustomed to thinking about the payment only at the end of the meal.\nWe think most of our users were the avid early adopters of technology products.\n These users loved Cashless, but this product was turning out to be very hard to scale beyond that. When it comes to deciding the success or failure of our products, we need to always look beyond the early adopters.\nThe cost of educating restaurant staff on Cashless was too high, and takes continuous maintenance.\n To begin with, we were bearing the cost of the iPad at these restaurants. That cost alone (in hindsight) makes the business look unviable. Over and above that, the continuous training required for the workforce at restaurants (which sees high attrition in itself), sends the costs associated with running this business through the roof.\nSumming it all up \u2013 customer acquisition cost was high.\n We all know that Cashless was a great user experience, and everyone who used it was delighted with the product and the convenience of not waiting around for the bill. But it wasn\u2019t financially viable for us to keep the business running, as the operational costs of running it exceeded the commissions the product was generating for us. Over time, no matter what we could do, the unit economics were just not going to work.\nThe Future of Cashless\nWe will bring Cashless back to Dubai, and to more markets, once we have the ecosystem in place to counter the above challenges. We will do this with Base and Book \u2013 our Point-of-Sale and Table Management systems. For now, we\u2019ll be rolling back Cashless completely in the next 7 days.\nTo make Cashless work, we will ensure that our table reservation system gets into as many restaurants as possible. Once that happens, the Cashless flow will become a natural part of a user\u2019s journey on Zomato (where one can opt into using Cashless at the time of making a table reservation). Also, we then won\u2019t have to install any additional hardware at the restaurant. Having our table reservation and/or POS systems on the restaurant premises will enable a truly Cashless experience for our users, as well as restaurants.\nWe\u2019d like to thank everyone involved in this first chapter of Zomato Cashless. Once we have Zomato Book and Zomato Base in restaurants everywhere, Cashless will work better as a product and a business, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re working towards."

        "content": "Seven years ago, we started out as a pure-play information directory for restaurants in India. Today, we are in 22 countries across the world, 15 of which we have launched and grown our business in organically. In the other seven, we acquired the local leaders in our space to eventually move all their traffic over to Zomato, becoming the #1 player in those markets in the process. Today, people the world over use Zomato to look for great places to eat over 90 million times every month. More than three quarters of these visitors are from outside of India.\nA few months ago, we made an important move in India \u2013 launching our online ordering service. And we\u2019ve really been kicking our competition\u2019s ass in this business with less than 0.1% of their marketing budgets. Why we were able to win? Because we have millions of users who already use us for ordering food over the phone. Now, they have started placing the same orders online using our app. And there is a lot of growth still left; 92% of our users who use Zomato to search for restaurants that deliver haven\u2019t even started ordering online on Zomato as yet. Our ticket sizes are more than double our competitors\u2019 \u2013 because our users are not using us for the discounts. They are using us for the convenience, and a product they already love Zomato for.\nOur users hold tremendous potential for transaction-based businesses. Getting into transactions was always the natural next step for our business. Online ordering is a natural and logical alternative for our users who, up until now, used to call restaurants to place their orders for delivery. Table reservations fit into Zomato as easily as online ordering did. The time has come for us to focus deeply on transactions in countries where it matters.\nWe are also going to have to make important changes to our business and make sure we put every dollar and every Zoman behind the things that matter the most. Here are two important things everyone can expect.\nContent 2.0\nWe will be getting smarter with the effort that we put into content. 40% of the restaurants on Zomato account for 92% of our traffic. We will rethink our processes to make sure that the frequency of our data updates goes up in multiples for the top 40% of restaurants.\nIn the meantime, we will push our Zomato for Business app as much as possible, so that more business owners start managing their listings themselves.\nThe countries we entered in the recent past have not been working with our existing model of collecting content and building community relations \u2013 alternate models will need to be identified and implemented. We have a few ideas we will be piloting in a select few regions right away.\nWe need to make some fundamental changes to the product to ensure more stickiness and growth. Most of these changes are based on what we have learned from Urbanspoon.\nOver time, as we fully transition to Content 2.0, we will need leaner content teams across the world.\nWe will split our countries into two types \u2013 \nFull Stack\n and \nEnterprise\nFull Stack\n are the four regions where \nall\n of the following hold true: a) large markets b) growing very fast c) Zomato is the strongest player in its space.\nThese four regions are India, the Middle East, South East Asia (the Philippines and Indonesia), and ANZ (Australia and New Zealand).\nWe will be selling our full suite of products in these four regions, since we have very high levels of traffic here.\nOur focus on ad sales will continue to be strong, along with all the other transaction-based businesses. Ad sales has been a very profitable business for us, and will continue to be so.\nEnterprise\n regions are the ones where \nany\n of the following is true: a) relatively small markets b) slow growth economies c) Zomato is not the dominant player. All the remaining markets belong to this category.\nIn these regions, we will not look at ad sales. We will focus mostly on transaction businesses, with a lion\u2019s share of our effort going into selling \nBook\n \u2013 our table reservations engine.\nWe will focus less on on-the-ground community building and marketing activities. Most of the people in our teams in these regions should be sales people, to help us put Zomato Book in as many restaurants as possible. This means that in these regions, our operations will need fewer people to run the show compared to the past.\nMost \nEnterprise\n regions will see all of these changes take effect starting immediately. All these things will also significantly bring down our burn rate and, as we go along, make our businesses in these markets much stronger.\nThe next few months are going to be hard for all of us. But we\u2019ll stick together, hustle, and not spend time overthinking things or being unnecessarily creative, so we can get to where we want to be."

        "content": "In the smartphone era, the scope of leveraging social media for personal and professional purposes has expanded and so has the fondness for food porn. As Instagram recently turned five, we took this opportunity to reveal how it has also changed the way people look at food \u2013 through filters and a square frame.\nMany chefs now flaunt their skills and upload pictures of beautifully plated dishes, travel tales and sources of inspiration. Given the constant attention, we try to find out if the social media attention has brought a change in the concept of plating up food, does it act as an effective marketing tool and has it bridged the gap between the chef and the consumer.\nThe megapixel meals\nChefs, customers and critics have now started looking at food through the lens. The smartphone era has given a shot-in-the-arm to this practice and now the food has to not only appeal to the palate, but also add up to a pretty picture. \u201cFood blogging started extensively around 2005-06 and now it has a defining influence on the industry. We used to have a secret code doing the rounds in the restaurant whenever a food critic or a blogger would come visiting \u2013 BFC (Big F**king Camera). In the smartphone era, even customers have started painfully documenting every single meal, which are then shared on their social media pages. So one needs to be considerate about what guests are experiencing,\u201d says Chef Alex Sanchez from The Table, Mumbai.\nBut has it made the chefs more conscious about how they present food? \u201cPresentation is definitely an important concept of dining. When you evolve as a chef, you make sure that the dishes are technically sound and the presentation is as natural as possible; because personally, I like food that is less played with,\u201d says Chef Sanchez who has more than 5,000 followers on Instagram.\nAuthor, TV show host and chef, Saransh Goila, adds that there is no room for error in the culinary world. \u201cJust because people are now uploading pictures of dishes doesn\u2019t mean that chefs were not careful about what went to the customer\u2019s table in the good old days. So, to insinuate that social media is the reason behind neater and better presented food is grossly unfair.\u201d\nTV show host, food columnist and Chef, Ranveer Brar, who has more than 11,800 followers on Instagram seconds, \u201cChefs are always conscious. Picture or no picture, it doesn\u2019t matter. The food must look and taste good.\u201d He calls this an era of \u2018instant gratification\u2019. \u201cI have to admit though that with immediate uploading and sharing, chefs have definitely become more enthusiastic about plating up.\u201d\nChef Goila, who has around 6,900 followers on Instagram adds, \u201cThe concept of plating up has changed phenomenally in the last five years. Plates, cutlery and the drama grabs a lot of attention. Apart from taste, presentation also has a strong recall value. Be it chefs or amateur customers, everyone is more careful about clicking a picture the right way to make it look its best.\u201d\nOne-click marketing tool called \u2018upload\u2019\nWhile most accounts are personal, they have, by default, become a platform to spread the word about respective restaurants and grab people\u2019s attention. Seeing what goes behind the kitchen has become a crowd puller which many use to their advantage for promotional purposes. \u201cA study states that the brand recall value on Instagram is 45%, which is much higher compared to 20% on Facebook and 26% on Twitter. Every time you try to sell something on Instagram, the conversion is very high. When I was on my 10-city book tour, all my guests who contacted me through Instagram, were there to attend it. But we must take into consideration that not every chef is tech savvy. When it comes to a majority of restaurants, those who are deep into the kitchen are barely connected to the consumers. Mostly it is the people at the front desk who are handling these social media accounts. Thus the onus is on them to guide those working inside the kitchen basis the feedback and comments that they get.\u201d says Goila.\n\u201cI never had an account on Instagram. But when I was suggested to open one, it was interesting to see the kind of engagement, feedback and comments that I got. Honestly, it eventually worked out as a very effective marketing tool. It was not an attempt to make it one,\u201d says Sanchez. \u201cFollowers on my pages are often curious to find out more details of the dishes I photograph and try it out for themselves. It opens up a perfect window of opportunity to invite them over and get immediate feedback, which is a lot of interactive fun,\u201d he adds.\nCreating a consumer connect\nThe Instagram accounts of chefs are mostly a timeline of their journey, inspiration and experimentation. Today, an average foodie is quite intrusive about finding out the stories behind the dish served and the chef behind it. It has bridged a gap between the table and the kitchen which has led to revolutionizing the consumer connect aspect.\n\u201cMy Instagram account is a personal one. It is about spontaneity and gives the people a peek into who the real Ranveer is. It helps them get an understanding about the my background and the influences and flavours in my food. Social media platforms have played an important role in reinventing the image of chefs from being the behind-the-curtain magic-workers to front-facing creators in the kitchen. This has made them more approachable, accessible and interactive,\u201d says Chef Brar.\n\u201cIt puts the customers in my shoes. They are excited to see what I get to eat as well \u2013 like burgers and sandwiches. It highlights me my food preferences and gives them a better understanding of the kind of chef I am. This platform is interactive and I mostly maintain a positive feedback on my pages (because you can delete the negative comments),\u201d Chef Sanchez laughs. \u201cIt is a two-way street. It is no longer about hiring chefs who cook for people. Chefs are revolutionizing food and there is a dialogue on both sides. Social media platforms have helped in starting that dialogue,\u201d he adds.\nChef Goila feels that every Instagram account has a character and tells a chef\u2019s tale. \u201cWhen I shared posts about my show \u2018Sadak Chef\u2019 which was about street food and traveling across India, it helped me to get my personality across to my followers. The audio and the visual has a much stronger impact now. On a personal level, my own posts sometimes help me chart my journey. I refer to them as a guide book to create dishes that I probably learnt at a point of time and cannot recollect anymore. The accounts give an identity to a chef as they have a character or a theme that they stick to.\u201d\nBut there is a flip-side to it as well. \u201cUnfortunately, social media doesn\u2019t know where to draw the line. Every chef has been professionally trained for someone to challenge that. The task is now professional training vs. understanding. The entire joy of surprising the customer has gone away. Nothing is enough for them. People are ready to move on and do something new. Only few places like Indigo in Mumbai or the Big Chill Cafe in Delhi have the privilege of having the advantage of nostalgia; for everyone else, it is a tough task and they have to fight for the spot. Now chefs and restauranteurs are being forced to debate the social media vigilantes. While the pressure in the kitchen is more than enough, now there is an additional pressure of being scrutinized on social media platforms as well.\u201d"

        "author": "kanika",
        "content": "India has proven to be a paradise for foodies. To cater to the hungry Millenia, there are a number of restaurants that have now become a platform for young chefs to not only showcase their talent but also turn their passion into a rewarding profession.\nWith new age restaurants, there has been a surge in the number of young chefs who have been given the responsibility of heading kitchens, creating differentiated menus and delivering stand-out service.\n\u201cNew age restauranteurs have a high proclivity to appoint younger chefs as their ideas and concepts are better aligned to them. Someone who has worked in the hotel industry for a protracted period of time, gets used to \u2018old school\u2019 methods and tricks. Their adaptability quotient climbs down as they start doing things by the book. On the other hand, the younger chefs on the block, have adapted very quickly to the changing market trends,\u201d says the25-year-old Anahita Dhondy, Chef Manager at SodaBottleOpenerWala \u2013 Bombay Irani Cafe, part of Olive Group\u2019s restaurant by Sabina and AD Singh.\nHimanshu Saini, 27, Chef at Tresind, Dubai, shares a similar view. \u201cYounger chefs are now taking on enlarged roles because they are open to ideas and learning on the job. When you open an Indian restaurant, it might be a bit difficult to explain to a senior chef as to why you don\u2019t want to cook the butter chicken or the tikka in a traditional way. The idea is push yourself and your team to present new creations on the plate.\u201d\nChiming in, the Executive Chef of The Bombay Canteen, Thomas Zacharias, 29, says, \u201cEnergy, vigor and enthusiasm are traits that the young generation of chefs possess. Passion and determination play an essential role in putting up good food on the table. Trained young chefs bring out a fresh perspective on the plate and their passion is translated into their dishes.\u201d\nTheir kitchen rules\nWorking in the kitchen is a team effort, even if it is about putting up just one dish. The task at hand is to work with senior and seasoned chefs when younger and less experienced chefs head the kitchen. \u201cMy kitchen staff consists of many young chefs. But when you come from a point of authority, you do garner respect. Age does not play a role in how much respect one gets. We all are educated and there is no negativity. We also look up to the seasoned chefs,\u201d says Thomas. \u201cWe make it a point to hire young chefs so that our wavelengths match. It isn\u2019t that difficult to be taken seriously when you are good at your work because even your fellow chefs learn from you. Seasoned and senior chefs may or may not be rigid in the kitchen, but sometimes it is difficult to work with them. The most important thing is maintaining a good environment. When it comes to the kitchen, I have very clear rules in terms of what needs to be delivered,\u201d adds Himanshu.\nFor Anahita, who is a successful female chef in a male dominated bastion, the challenge is slightly more complex. \u201cWorking with senior and more experienced chefs, can be a daunting task. The challenge has two facets to it \u2013 experience and gender. Sometimes they make you feel inadequate because they believe that you have grown too quickly without appropriate experience on your resume. On other occasions, you come across stereotypical gender issues in the kitchen. When it all comes together it can get overwhelming \u2013 but you need to work with blinders on in the kitchen. This profession can be ruthless and you need to be driven by passion and steely determination if you want to survive. I am the only Parsi here. So my role is more than just managerial. I also need to ensure that whatever is being created is authentic enough. So often I need to put my foot down and be relentless.\u201d\nNeedless to say, these chefs with enviable pedigree and resumes have become a role model for many. Given the limelight and the glamour quotient attached to the kitchen, becoming a chef is now no longer considered a Plan B. Most of these younger chefs have become social media darlings, with a documented history of their food pursuits, and a swelling fan base.\nThe class of chefs\n\u201cBack in the day, we did not have enough access to TV shows, books and knowledge about the industry. If I talk about the next generation of chefs, given the kind of access that they will have to all the mediums, they will be much better equipped than we are. I am a self taught chef and learnt mostly through trials and experimentation. Along with greater access to resources, even the the mindset of parents is shifting. They are letting their children do whatever they want to do, and exercise their free will. Creativity and a free hand to experiment fuels the imagination of a good chef. I am all about Molecular Cooking. What many do not understand is that it requires such detailed study of the ingredients. Understanding each component, its reactions and creating something extra ordinary with something predictable. It is almost like studying the science of cooking and cracking it every single time,\u201d says Himanshu.\n\u201cWhat many do not understand is that molecular cooking\u00a0requires such detailed study of the ingredients. Understanding each component, its reactions and creating something extra ordinary with something predictable. It is almost like studying the science of cooking and cracking it every single time.\u201d\nThomas concludes, \u201cStand alone establishments have become a breeding ground for young, promising talent. I credit social media and food shows for shifting the limelight on the creators in the kitchen. I have to concede that earlier this profession wasn\u2019t half as prestigious as it is considered today, and not many considered it or pursued it seriously. However, the draw to the profession shouldn\u2019t be the \u2018endorsement factor\u2019. Someone who loves food and their craft enough, doesn\u2019t need to consider extraneous factors in making a choice.\u201d"

        "content": "Paul Cunningham is a chef, a wanderer, a proud author and a photographer. He was schooled and trained as a chef at various British restaurants and country house hotels.\nThe co-owner of The Paul \u2013 Tivoli Garden in Copenhagen \u2013 he has been the head chef at Henne Kirkeby Kro, Denmark since 2012.\nHe also helped The Paul earn a Michelin star in 2003, which was tagged to it until 2011. In a tete-a-tete with Zomato, the celebrated author of 7 books talks to us about a variety of subjects ranging from simplicity of recipes and their presentation techniques, to the benefits of leveraging social media.\nHow important do you think is the presentation of food?\nAsk a blind man\u2026 it\u2019s an obvious fact that food should be visually appealing, but the trend at the moment of making everything look like a forest-floor or a sea-bed is something I find tiring and irritating. I am a firm believer that one should take as little time as possible in plating a dish, so that the presentation is simplistic and the product shines through. No dish should be so contrived that it needs to be analysed before being eaten.\nWhy is the simplicity of the dish important?\nFor me, simplicity is paramount. But to do this, to execute a simple dish perfectly, the ingredient needs to be absolutely fresh. I can serve a simple salad, washed and dressed with no fuss because I know exactly where it comes from. If you are clear about the providence of your product, you will be able to do this. I buy the seed from a reputable source and I sow the seed in untreated earth. I then water the seed and care for the plant. I pick the greens at their prime, quickly wash them, dress the salad and serve it. Simple.\nThere is an old tradition here at Henne, that has been carried on for generations. We go into the garden in the morning and pick just enough ingredients for lunch. We rest in the afternoon, and pick again just before dinner. As a diner you will find the dish deeply flavorful because of the fact that the potatoes that you are served were actually underground only moments before they arrive on your plate.\nFor me, simplicity is paramount. But to do this, to execute a simple dish perfectly, the ingredient needs to be absolutely fresh. I can serve a simple salad, washed and dressed with no fuss because I know exactly where it comes from.\nDo you think badly presented food can kill the appetite of a person?\nAbsolutely. But perfectly presented food also kills me. Too many stagi\u00e8res and volunteers, too many people in the kitchen, too many fingers in my food! I find overworked, over-styled food very, very unappetizing indeed.\nWhat are the other things, apart from food, that are important to build a restaurant, a customer connect and its image?\nHonesty, honesty, honesty. Do what you do and do it to your very best. Be inspired by your peers, but find your own way \u2013 this will only come through with experience and age.\nRegarding customer contact and image, this too happens naturally at our house. We employ no PR or marketings people, it\u2019s all done in-house. I run my own social media feeds, they follow me everyday. Images are posted most naturally, without too much thought. I have a general 10 second rule with social media images; If I\u2019m not happy with a particular image within 10 seconds, I won\u2019t post it.\nYou are extremely active on Instagram. Has it helped in boosting your business in any way?\nYes, with reference to our branding and marketing initiatives. Before social media became a part of our lives, I have only ever relied on one source of marketing \u2013 word-of-mouth. Personal, first-hand referrals are the very best type of recommendations that one can receive. I have never ever personally placed an advert within a magazine or newspaper. I was once told by my old Jedi Master that respect and humility is everything. Be a good guy, make your concept so interesting that writers just can\u2019t help but write about you. I try.\nHow important do you think it is to leverage social media when it comes to promoting a restaurant/cooking?\nNowadays social media plays a massive roll in our lives, but we should all be very careful that is does not take control. I can always tell when folks think too much before posting images. Never try to create an image, just let it happen.\nWhen a chef curates a menu, what are the few important things that he should keep in his mind?\nSimplicity, seasonality and sustainability within menus are fundamental when writing menus.\nIn an era of scientific cooking, is it important to stick to some old school methods?\nI have two mottos that hang over the door of my kitchen, and maybe my life \u2013 \u2018Tradition over trend\u2019 and \u2018The Old School is the only School\u2019.\nYou received a star from Guide Michelin seven months after you opened your restaurant \u2013 The Paul. What do you think led to such massive success in such a short span of time?\nA happy, honest house, that feels like home."

        "content": "Chef Cyrus Todiwala and his wife Pervin are the brains behind Cafe Spice Namaste\u00a0that is\u00a0considered a shining example of Indian cuisine in the UK.\nCyrus, who has been credited with the distinction of cooking for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, as part of the Queen\u2019s Diamond Jubilee celebrations, believes that his restaurant is a breeding ground for fresh ideas and a sacred place where the chefs are \u201callowed to do their jobs\u201d.\n\u201cBack in London, my customers have complete faith in me. They often request Pervin to organize elaborate luncheons for 18-20 people and don\u2019t even involve themselves in the menu selection. Unfortunately, customers in India like to give multiple instructions about the food which destroys the creativity of the chef. Additionally, it also damages the balance of the dish, diluting the experience on the palette,\u201d says the chef who made his debut in the Indian market with his restaurant \u2013 The River by Cyrus, Goa. He adds, \u201cWe hope to get experimental with food and create a similar trust that I share with people back in London.\u201d\nThe restaurant boasts of a personalized fusion menu with strong Goan influences and the chef\u2019s signature global style. Chef Cyrus elaborates on the concept behind the restaurant, \u201cWe aim to add a personal touch to every customer\u2019s dining experience. I wanted to apply my learnings from my stint at the Taj where I served as the Corporate Executive Chef with the Holiday Village, The Fort Aguada Beach Resort and the Aguada Hermitage, Goa for eight\u00a0years in the 1980s. In established hotels chefs often interact with guests and inquire about their dining experience. However, at the Taj we took it a step further and I personally created special menus for long stay guests to break away from the monotony of the predictable spread.\u201d\nCyrus has also been the advocate of using local, seasonal produce and uses the same mentality for his current Goan restaurant. \u201cThe idea is to keep it simple \u2013 a tight, restricted menu with five\u00a0suggested dishes everyday that can be cooked basis the availability of fresh ingredients. We also hope that the customers trust us enough to not take a look at the menu. An element of surprise often adds an interesting dimension to it.\u201d\nRounding back to the point he made earlier, Chef Cyrus stresses, \u201cYou need to trust the chef the way you trust your doctor. You would never question a doctor on the medicines that he prescribes to you. Similarly, you must try not to question the chef who prepares a meal for you. There is a lot of effort that goes constructing a menu, defining the ingredients and creating the flavors. Moreover, you need to have faith, that whatever has been ordered is what will be served in its best possible form. Keep an open mind and do not try to alter the dish so that it loses its very essence.\u201d"

        "content": "In an era where food businesses are exploring different markets, there are some that have stuck to their home ground and resisted the temptation to expand beyond. But is expansion always proportional to good business? Not necessarily, as we discover.\nCreating a successful franchise is a complex and tricky process and a lot of people don\u2019t get it right. Dilution of quality, botched-up service experience and lack of a personal touch are some of the common challenges.\nWe went exploring and got in touch with a few businesses, that have intentionally dodged the lure of expanding their businesses beyond their home cities, even though their fan-base transcends boundaries.\nTheobroma, Mumbai:\n\u201cWhen we started the business approximately 11 years ago, there was no precedent for what we were venturing into. It was a completely new concept and we learnt entirely through the process of trial and error. Experience has been our greatest tutor,\u201d says Kainaz Messman Harchandrai, Head of Production, Theobroma Foods Pvt Ltd. \u201cOver the years we have been able to preserve the original taste and that is what has kept our customers walking through our doors,\u201d she adds.\nTheobroma, that acquired a cult status in Bombay and made brownies and cookies commonplace, firmly resisted the urge to expand out of the city, thus far. Kainaz sheds some light on this, \u201cFirstly, we were a family run business so branching out of Bombay wasn\u2019t on the cards. Secondly, given the frenetic pace of life in the city, it was highly unlikely that people would travel beyond their self-contained neighborhoods for food. So we decided to make the most of it by branching out to different parts of the city and that itself was a huge endeavor. Finally, Bombay has people living and visiting from all parts of the country, so we do cater to a lot of customers who don\u2019t call the city home.\u201d However, even Theobroma does its bit to cater to the brownie and dessert fiends across the country through selective courier services.\nHowever, leaving the safe house, Theobroma plans to expand, but with caution, \u201cIt is a step-by-step process. Since its a family run venture, we are still trying to work out the finer details of managing it in a professional format from a remote location. Opening in a new market is exploring unchartered territory and we are working on making sure that our quality standards aren\u2019t diluted in any way.\u201d .\nElma\u2019s, New Delhi:\nChef Shelly Sahay, behind Elma\u2019s Bakery in Hauz Khas Village (HKV) gives us a peak into how one of the most famous bakeries in the Capital started because of their frustration to source quality bread for their cafe venture \u2013 The Living Room (TLR) Cafe. \u201cIt all started in 2011 with the need to get quality bread. The cakes eventually came out of boredom and now they have taken over,\u201d she says.\nJust about four-years-old, the bakery has two outlets in Delhi. \u201cWe decided to open the bakery in Delhi because we were already running TLR Cafe in HKV. As we expanded the range, we opened the brasserie in Meharchand market,\u201d she says. \u201cWe make sure that the quality is not affected. There are times when I have carried liters of lemon juice and bundles of chocolates to make sure we replicate the perfect taste. If we do not have enough cocoa, we would not bake a chocolate cake and serve it,\u201d she adds.\nHowever, the ambition for Elma\u2019s is not limited to Delhi alone. Shelly adds, \u201cI would like to open a store in Mumbai as I share a close association with the place. London also has a huge draw, as I have lived here for 42 years.\nL\u2019Opera, New Delhi:\nLaurent Samandari, who worked in a straight-jacketed role with Usha Appliances, always harbored a desire to start off his own enterprise in the food space. Frequent business visits to France, introduced him to the concept of cute and quaint Parisian patisseries. He realised that the Indian market was ripe with opportunity to introduce the concept. He adds, \u201cIn 2008 it was difficult to find these kind of products. It was limited to only five-star hotels like the Imperial or the Oberoi. There weren\u2019t many bakeries or chains that existed either. So when I started thinking about it, it made sense to start something like this.\u201d\n\u201cThe family sat down and started to work on the business plan. It took us some time to crystallize the concept, find a production facility and the kitchen. Meanwhile, we worked hard on the raw materials to ascertain if it we could work with what was available. We asked our close and trusted friends to taste every product and share brutal feedback, as the Indian palate is fundamentally different from a European one. We also sought help from the French Embassy, that generously shared their kitchen space for almost a week for testing the final product.\u201d\nAnd so it began. \u201cWe started with our first shop and counters in 2011. The first ones were opened at the DLF Golf Club, the French Embassy and Khan Market. We also catered for events as a precursor to the store openings and it only reinforced our faith in the product as the customers liked our concept and the product.\u201d\nL\u2019Opera has now expanded to 12 outlets in Delhi and Gurgaon. They continue to focus on the Parisian experience in every outlet. They have also started with lunch menus where they continue to focus on typical French dishes like vol-au-vent, salads and quiches that can be found in a traditional brasserie in Paris .\n\u201cGiven that there are so many competitors in the industry, staying true to our niche has been the underpinning theme of our success\u201d, says Samandari. Given its popularity, one may be tempted to ask about their resistance to expand beyond the home turf. Laurent elaborates, \u201cI was living in Delhi, so this seemed to be the right thing to do. Besides, Delhi has a lot of potential given the mix of the population and the large expat contingent. Though we are planning to open an outlet in Mumbai, followed by Bangalore, I feel even with 12 outlets we haven\u2019t adequately covered the Delhi and NCR territory.\u201d\nContaining the business to one city also has its own perks \u2013 personalization being the principal one. While Shelly is often spotted baking in her kitchen and sharing samples with her customers for feedback, Kainaz and her family try to give as much personal attention to their customers by physically being there."

        "author": "kanika",
        "content": "Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, Starbucks, Wendy\u2019s, Krispy Kreme, Johnny Rockets, Taco Bell and many other international food brands have made their way into India. Though established, bringing them here is a challenge in itself. \nTo understand what goes into it, we spoke to Chef Bakshish Dean, Executive Director at Prime Gourmet Pvt Ltd. about getting the famous American burger food chain Johnny Rockets to Indian foodies.\n\u201cIt took us a year to get everything in place before we opened our first outlet at the Select Citywalk mall. The whole exercise was really tedious but rewarding,\u201d says Dean.\nThere are various things that need to be considered when international brands expand to a potential market. Apart from getting the basics right like the legality and licenses; it is important to understand the dining demographics and identify if the people are prepared to try out something new. \u201cOne needs to identify the potential of the concept \u2013 will it excite the customers; are there enough takers to sustain this as a business; study of demographics to understand the consumer bank and their spending power would be really important. Another important thing is to know if it is the right time to introduce the concept. Understand the capital investment aspect of it \u2013 if it is conducive to the market; what is the recovery time and how healthy are the returns.\u201d\n\u201cYou also need to understand the supply chain and the level of development that it will require along with the technical support and its availability to service the machinery,\u201d he adds.\nOne of the most important aspects of a food chain that needs to be dealt with most carefully is its menu. While it is imperative to stay true to the brand, it is also important to be able to match the palate of the customer. As the contents are altered to suit the taste, a lot of planning goes into its implementation and application. Given the various bans on meat products in our country, the entire effort of making the brand work, goes up a notch. \u201cIt is important to keep the brand\u2019s identity intact. It is necessary to review the offering and identify the areas which will need to be worked upon. One also needs to develop a menu based on the ingredients that would be available in the local market. You also need to develop local fabricators and suppliers who can support the concept. Map the local palette and have some offerings that connect well with that and replicate the guest experience,\u201d adds Dean.\nCreating a connect is as essential. \u201cIt was really important for us to work with profiles that connect with the customer. The reason was simple \u2013 we wanted \u201call\u201d our customers to connect well with our menu offering,\u201d says he.\nBut at the same time it was important to retain the originality of the brand and making sure that it was done right keeping in mind the minutest of details; something as minuscule as getting the dance moves right. \u201cDance is an integral part of the experience that we offer. Johnny Rockets as a brand stands for \n\u201cwhere the good times roll\u201d\n. We don\u2019t say our food or service is the best, we say the overall experience at Johnny Rockets is great. We have to ensure that the identity of the brand stays intact and that is only possible if you get into all the little details and implements them.\u201d\nChef Dean agrees that International food chains tend to do better in India as compared to home grown food franchises. He also feels that given the projections that have been made on the economic growth of the Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) segment in India, many International brands flock the market and has turned India into a prime target for them.\nWith expansion continuing on a fast pace, Dean comments, \u201cIndian food brands just need to step up their game and match up to International standards. If they achieve that they could then look at leading the pack.\u201d"

        "author": "kanika",
        "content": "Evolving tastes have not only brought about a shift in trends, but have also affected the process of establishing restaurants. While it may seem like a simple enough formula, it is much more complicated than that dish in front of you with a fancy name. \nIn an effort to paint a clear picture, we sat down with food critic \nMarryam H Reshii\n to identify the changes in dining trends, the role of reviews, lifestyle and many other things affecting the food culture. You might also find hints of what Marryam looks at when she reviews a restaurant.\nShe started writing about food in 1998, and recalls restaurants that would focus on North Indian, Chinese, and Italian \u2013 all at the same time. \u201cAnd then there was McDonald\u2019s\u201d, she adds. But now, every cuisine has a restaurant dedicated to it. There are many factors that define the dining trends, and have caused shifts in the restaurant business.\nShe started writing about food in 1998, and recalls restaurants that would focus on North Indian, Chinese, and Italian \u2013 all at the same time. \u201cAnd then there was McDonald\u2019s\u201d, she adds.\nMarryam states some of the factors that have influenced changes the most in restaurants and the dynamics of dining out.\nHealth is wealth:\n \nFor the restaurants with a fine salad selection on their menu! \u201cToday no one can boast about eating traditional Indian food. With dietitians in the picture, people are drifting more towards healthy eating. High cholesterol count is a genetic disposition which not a secret. Hence, you have cold pressed juices and salad lunches that are gaining momentum. Places like Salad Days and Raw Leaf are in business because the people are now opting for a healthy lifestyle,\u201d says Marryam. \nShe adds that it is nearly impossible to focus at work after a heavy Indian meal because lethargy sets in. So if you want to be more productive, healthy \u2013 not heavy \u2013 food is a preferred choice.\u00a0\nWork culture:\nThere is employment but not office space. On any given weekday, if we visit a cafe, we find most of the customers occupying seats on day-dates with their laptops. \u201cI often get bored of sitting at home and writing my stories, so I step out for a change and sit at a cafe to complete it. My basic need is a cup of coffee or tea, a sandwich if I feel hungry, and Wi-Fi. If all these facilities help me get my work done, I am happy. This is exactly why you find cafes like Barista, Cafe Coffee Day and Starbucks always occupied.\u201d \nMore than that, they also serve as suitable locations for team-building activities, brainstorming, interviews, and even tuitions.\nSharing an example, \u201cPerch in Khan Market is a coffee and wine bar with a selection of eats. It\u2019s a quiet set up that could be an ideal place to work. A calm ambience and a glass of good cold coffee would be enough for me, since eating or drinking is not the focus. Such things bring the suggestive selling aspect into the picture, where the chef can offer something off the menu to a regular customer and help build a relationship.\u201d\nNo tech, no logic:\nThere are many things that restaurants need to focus on but being up to date with tech systems is an integral part as well, says Marryam. \u201cA lot of restaurateurs now focus on every small detail \u2013 be it ambience, the mood, the food, or services \u2013 and have tried to make up where they can. Apart from that, technology has caught on in a big way. From free Wi-Fi to KOTs (Kitchen Order Ticket), everything is quick, savvy and leaves minimal room for error. I once visited a place in Noida, placed my order, and the waiter returned after 10 minutes to confirm it because he had written it and could not recollect the order, for whatever reasons. I was shocked.\u201d\nCCTV surveillance is as important, she says. \u201cA lady once visited a restaurant and when she was leaving, her bag was gone. So the restaurant owners reviewed the footage and identified the culprits. Such things bring reassurance and a necessary safety factor into consideration. It might seem fancy, but in reality, is quite basic.\u201d\nThe Spark:\nSitting with one of the most renowned food critics, it was impossible to not ask what she looks for in a restaurant when she goes to review it. \u201cI look for that spark. It could be from the moment you walk in, or could even be the hospitality. It is difficult to put a finger on it. If we talk about Big Chill Cafe, it is the posters. If we talk about Perch, it is the big Cyprus tree, the wooden floors and the white walls. It could also be the first dish presented, or a small yet interesting menu.\u201d\nResult of reviews:\nMarryam feels that reviews may or may not affect a restaurant\u2019s image and its business. \u201cIt mostly depends on who is writing it. Sometimes, people use platforms to unnecessarily defame the restaurant owner/competitors, which is a bit disheartening. Anyone who is writing or reading a review to form an opinion must keep in mind its tonality and identify if it is justified or personal. A lady once wrote a really negative review of Monkey Bar, and when I asked Manu (Chandra), he told me the real reason behind it: her tantrums were not being entertained. I felt it was unfair to the restaurant.\u201d \n\u201cAnother time, I visited Carnatic Cafe in New Friends Colony, and the food there was brilliant. But when he asked me to check the reviews written, people had complained about things like service being refused or delayed while the staff was taking a break to eat food. We need to understand that even servers and restaurant owners are allowed to have a lunch time. I agree this is not Germany, but if the customer is refused, they take out their frustration on open platforms and defame these places.\u201d\nStarting tip for start-ups:\n\u201cHonesty is the best policy, even in the restaurant business\u201d says Marryam. \u201cIf you have decided to open a restaurant in Delhi in areas like Kamla Nagar, North Campus or Satya Niketan, you should be prepared to work to your maximum advantage. Given the student crowd, one has to focus on the pricing of the menu to match the affordability and the purchasing power, but not compromise on the quality. \nOne needs to keep the health and creativity aspects in mind as well. For example, Diggin in Anand Lok serves these zucchini chips that are absolutely delicious. The portions are generous, and it also happens to be one of the few restaurants that is pet-friendly, which helps cater to a newer niche of patrons. You need to have some kind of integrity towards your business and the customer as well because they will figure it out and that will help you build loyalty with them.\u201d"

        "content": "With great skill comes great responsibility, and in the culinary world, that is only magnified. While on one hand it is important to cook keeping in mind the ever-changing dining trends, one also has to find ways and means to stay true to the passion that got them into the business to begin with.\nChef Manu Chandra feels just that. The Chef Partner at Monkey Bar and The Fatty Bao (Bangalore, Mumbai and New Delhi) and Executive Chef Olive Beach, Bangalore, he has a lot on his plate, but then his appetite justifies that.\nIt is the era of experimentation and indulging in good food. Despite the myriad options available, from the business aspect, sometimes there is a need to stick to the tested and tried. The skill sometimes lies in creating the obvious in a more interesting way than cooking something out of the box.While Chef Manu explains the reasons behind the rising trends, he also shares the reason behind having a bowl of french fries on the menu.\n\u201cWe are currently in the thick of food trends. With various verticals specializing in cuisines like Modern Indian, Regional, Asian and many more, it has already moved up a notch. To add on to it, the prevalence of focussing on the experiential aspect is quite fantastic for the general evolution of the restaurant industry,\u201d says Manu.\n\u201cThe demand for better food is now increasing as the consumer is ready to experiment and has greater willingness and propensity to spend\u201d, he explains. \u201cCustomers seek a lot more places when they decide to dine out and therefore, there is a need to not only cater to their choices but also feed the sentiment. This millennia is hungry and have a disposable income that they like to spend on good food and a good experience that is making them indulge on a very large scale.\u201d\nIt is these factors that have led to restaurants upping their game. \u201cOnce you get into the restaurant business, you are in it for the longest time. It is a large space that is indistinguishable. Hence, it is important for each restaurant to stand out and stick to the ground in order to survive. The customer\u2019s expectations are high and therefore it is the cumulative output of experience, proficiency and execution that helps in maintaining a stable restaurant ethos,\u201d he adds.\nOne of the best ways to engage customers is to constantly innovate. While some can afford do that, there are others that need to stick to the theme and \u2018safe foods\u2019 to maintain the decorum of the restaurant.\n\u201cThere is a large awakening as far as tastes are concerned. But if we talk about a place like Monkey Bar, that has a \u2018chilled out\u2019 ambience, we need to keep in mind the mode of the product and focus on the tried and tested, hearty dishes. But at the same time, it is important that they are well put together into the overall experience of the place.\u201d While the new generation is all ready to try all-things-new, there are many that want to fall back on the comfort food.\nHe adds, \u201cOne has to put safe food on the menu. Sometimes you have to be completely averse to experimentation because the demand is for that one bowl of french fries. This is a part of the package and comes with the F&B establishment and execution. There is definitely a conflict when you must swallow your ego and focus on the commercial aspect versus the passion. You can\u2019t really help it but let things be because you must stick to the sanctity of the place.\u201d\nHe compliments those who constantly focus on changing menus based on seasonal produce. \u201cIt is admirable when restaurants make the most of the seasonality and the local ingredients. For something like this to be successful, you need a strong Chef in your kitchen whom you can trust and who can constantly innovate.\u201d"

        "author": "kanika",
        "content": "Trotting around the globe, Chef Ritu Dalmia labels her travels as an inspiration for her culinary journey. Known as the \u2018Queen of Italian food\u2019, she currently has six restaurants in Delhi under the Diva banner, dedicated to different cuisines but with a hint of Italian in each.\nDigging deep into the Indian love for Italian food, we sat down with Chef Dalmia to understand its authenticity and the secret behind good Italian food. \u201cOne thing I have followed my entire life is to use very good ingredients. What you call a trend is basically how creative, funky or fun you can get with the ingredients.\u201d\n\u201cTwo of my favorite vegetables are Pumpkin and Beetroot. All these years, in every menu of my restaurants, you will find something with Pumpkin and Beetroot. It was never sold, up until the last three years, when customers couldn\u2019t get enough of these two vegetables. Though I do not believe in \u2018trends\u2019 but I guess, in this case, going back to the basics could be looked at as a trend. I am really bored of using fancy vegetables and now love experimenting with cauliflower, yam and radish.\u201d\nThough there are many Italian restaurants in the city, there is scope for it to be further regionalized like Indian food. \u201cLet\u2019s face it dosa and naan are not the same and it is exactly the same with Italian. The food in Sicily and Umbria is much different than that available in Rome, Florence or Milan.\u201d\n\u201cThe customers have started traveling and not only to traditional destinations, but have also started exploring small towns in the region and hence are being introduced to new Italian flavors. Thus, now there is a need to get adventurous with the choices offered. I hope, in my lifetime, to see a restaurant that is not just about an Italian restaurant, but about a Sicilian or a Napolitani or a Sardinian restaurant.\u201d\nAnother influencing factor is the shift towards healthy diet. \u201cI have never sold so many quinoa salads in my life as I have done in the last couple of years. Earlier healthy food was considered to be bad and tasteless and now it is changing. A lot of people now keep in mind the goodness of the ingredient. I won\u2019t be surprised if we see holistic and vegan restaurants make their way into the market. Molecular cooking is a thing of the past. It is all about good ingredients, wholesome comfort food and goodness of ingredients. The clients and customers are now well educated; sooner or later, restaurants will have to take that approach in their cooking.\u201d\nWhile the tastes are evolving with time, the onus lies on restauranteurs and chefs to educate the consumers about it as well. \u201cThe first Italian Khana show that I did with NDTV was only about Italian ingredients. I had people coming to my restaurant and asking why the smoked salmon is cold? Or saying that the truffles stink (it is an acquired taste). The idea was to educate people. Today, after 15 years, our truffles are booked and our customers order well in advance. They have been educated and there is still a long way to go. We have never gone away from authenticity at Diva GK 2. In 15 years, the changes that I have seen, the things that I have put on the menu, I would have never dared to put them. We change the menu every three months and there is always that one thing that I put on the menu, knowing that it might or might not work. In some ways, I am challenging myself and challenging the guests as well.\u201d\nSharing some interesting examples of Indian influence over Italian food, she tells us, \u201cI once visited Le Calandre, a three starred Michelin restaurant in Padua, Italy. The chef, Massimiliano Alajmo, had something on his menu which was pasta with kurukuma (haldi). Another restaurant I visited had a pasta with green beans, snow peas with pinch of garam masala, on the menu.\u201d"

        "content": "We\u2019ve been in the business of connecting people with great restaurants and dining experiences around them for the past seven years. Today, we\u2019re taking that a step further with the launch of \nZomato Whitelabel\n, a platform that enables restaurants to launch custom-branded native mobile apps, and bridge the gap between them and their customers.\nThe past couple of years have seen a massive growth of internet-first restaurants, who function on a \u2018no/own kitchen + own delivery + on-demand\u2019 model. However, traditional asset-heavy restaurants that dominate the restaurant industry are yet to harness the power and distribution of the internet and mobile to tap into the massive set of digitally connected consumers. The challenge for them thus far has been the lack of a single service provider who can offer a full suite of technologies they need to run an online presence that is seamlessly integrated with their operations. \nWith Zomato Whitelabel, restaurants will be able to launch market-ready apps in a matter of weeks with absolutely no technical knowledge required. These apps integrate seamlessly into all of Zomato\u2019s ancillary features such as Online Ordering, Table Reservations, in-app Cashless payments, Loyalty programs and our soon-to-be-launched Zomato Base. These apps also come with powerful business and marketing tools such as targeted push notifications, real-time information and menu management, and analytics all bundled in, allowing restaurants more time to focus on their core business of food and creating delightful dining experiences for customers.\nFor customers, this allows for one-on-one interactions with their favourite restaurants, access to exclusive events and offers, and loyalty programs, without having to navigate to them on the main Zomato app. \nWe already have over 100 restaurant brands on board, including top brands such as Miyabi Sushi & Bento in Dubai, Shizuku Ramen in Melbourne, and Summerhouse Cafe in New Delhi. We\u2019re hugely excited by the potential of the Whitelabel platform, and the role it is going to play in ushering restaurants into the interconnected, digital world."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/the-failure-of-nps/",
        "author": "sharadgoyal-blog",
        "content": "We periodically run anonymous Net Promoter Score (NPS) surveys across our worldwide team which, by the way, now consists of 3,000 people across 22 countries. In order to get a better understanding of how Zomans the world over feel, we slice and dice the results by country and function. This time around, as always, we followed the standard approach of asking, \u201cOn a scale of 1 to 10, how likely are you to refer a friend at Zomato?\u201d, followed up with \u201cPlease explain the reason for the assigned score.\u201d\nWe wanted to know the reasons behind the responses to better understand why someone would (or would not) refer a friend to join us, and to see if anything needed to be fixed. After going through many hundreds of responses to these two questions, we discovered something \u2013 we\u2019ll probably never get a very high internal NPS. And the reason, is our culture. While a positively skewed score is considered good, our definition of a high score is anything upward of 50%+. We\u2019re currently at an organisation-wide score of 35%+, and here are some responses \u2013 verbatim \u2013 that validate that figure (and let us breathe a little easier).\n\u201cNot all of my friends are Zomato material, and I wouldn\u2019t want to see all of them here. Zomato is a great place to work at, but you need to have a specific mindset to have a great time here, and that\u2019s why I wouldn\u2019t bring my friends to work with us.\u201d \n \n\u201cI won\u2019t give a 9 or 10 because I know most of my friends don\u2019t have what it takes and don\u2019t want to dedicate themselves so much to a job. It is their choice, not mine.\u201d\nThis one sums it up perfectly:\n\u201cI am glad to finally be able to explain my answer.\nI do not remember what scores I assigned on previous surveys, but they were never very high. In fact, they are getting lower. Does this mean I am not happy working here? No. Does this mean that I do not think of Zomato as a place to learn and grow? Absolutely not.\nWhy wouldn\u2019t I promote the very product I help developing, a product which I happen to think is so useful that I use everyday? Why would I diss what has been the most important part of my life for the past year?\nI talk incessantly about my life at Zomato and about my product. But this does not mean I would recommend all my friends to work at Zomato.\nWhen I started working here years ago, Zomato was nice. Back then, I would have totally recommend it to all my friends.\nBut then I started getting more involved. Work became more complex and demanding as I started getting more responsibilities. I started realizing that this isn\u2019t for everybody. This is hard work and wild dreams. You need to be completely focused, organized and a fierce prioritizer. You need to be fully invested in \nnow\n without losing focus on the big picture. What you are right now is never enough; you always feel a bit uncomfortable, a bit on the edge of the knife, a bit inexperienced and unskilled for what you are doing right now. And greatness thrives here.\nZomato is the greatest learning and growing place I ever had. I became a better person and professional because I have been pushed so much. It is not all nice and fun and games. This is ruthless and we know it.\nThis is also exactly what I love about working here. We foster no contentment and accept no incompetence. We as a company accept that this is not for everyone. So why do we lose our shit every time we do not score that high on this question? This does not necessarily mean there is something wrong with our culture. It does not even mean that our employee NPS is low.\nIt just means that we do not think that all our friends have what it takes to work here. While some of my friends just want a 9 to 5 job, others do not want to be out of their comfort zone. Some do not have the right profile to become anything higher than average around here. They are great friends and people, but will never make great Zomans.\u201d\u00a0\nAdding on:\n\u201cNot everyone would fit here. I would only refer friends who I think would thrive in this environment of frenetic pace, high amount of responsibility and a lot of thinking to do.\u201d \n\u201cZomato is definitely a place to learn and grow but I\u2019m not sure I would be comfortable referring a friend of mine. This is not a job for everyone. One has to be very passionate and tireless.\u201d \n\u201cYou have to be of a special breed to work here. It\u2019s hard work, it\u2019s incredible hours, it\u2019s hustle, it\u2019s working to find impossible solutions. I don\u2019t think a lot of my friends could handle it.\u201d \n\u201cI think that you have to be the right fit for Zomato. If you want to learn, have a lot of energy, see the glass half full and look for opportunities rather than excuses then this is a great place to learn and challenge yourself.\u201d\n\u2013\nThough the score might be low (by our high standards), the flip side highlights its uniqueness, and the reasons justify it well. The next time, we will run the NPS survey in a slightly different way, because sometimes one needs to bend a few rules to understand Zomato better. We\u2019ll keep you posted on how that goes."

        "author": "kanika",
        "content": "Be it a Sunday brunch or a post work hangout with colleagues, the one thing that is not amiss from the table is a mug of freshly brewed, craft beer. The classical definition of craft beer is \u201cbeer made in a traditional or non-mechanized way by a micro-brewery\u201d.\nWhile commercial beers are pasteurized and filtered and contain added preservatives, craft beers are fresh, flavorful and straight from the tap. \n \nDespite being far removed from the world of \u201chard spirits\u201d of scotch, vodka and gin, craft beer has nimbly made its way to India\u2019s hearts, and people have learnt to enjoy a fresh brew.\n\u201cBeer occupies a very different space in the consumer\u2019s mind when it comes to the \u2018alcohol\u2019 category. It is a lot more casual, fun and social. Beer has fast emerged as a \u201crecruitment agent\u201d for younger consumers within the alcohol category; gender-neutral and taste centric. It has also helped disrupt the resistance towards alcoholic beverages for a lot of traditional Indians, who no longer find it a taboo to reach out for their beer mug. The acceptance of beer and wine \u2013 perceived as \u2018softer\u2019 spirits \u2013 has certainly climbed up in the metropolitan cities in India,\u201d says \nAnkur Jain\n, Founder of Cerana Beverages who launched Bira 91 in India.\nCaring for the craft\nWhile many continue to enjoy their pints, India has developed a new found love for craft beer with a number of micro-breweries helping us to quench our growing thirst. Recently, the Delhi government contributed to this swelling trend by giving its nod for setting up licensed micro-brew pubs in the city. \u201cThe thirst for freshly brewed beer is growing undoubtedly! And there is a shift in the mix/preference for beers \u2013 from bottled beers to craft beers (also known as artisan beers). Now the nomenclature has evolved to this exotic levels for a reason,\u201d says \nTJ Venkateshwaran\n, Founder and\u00a0Brand Owner TJ\u2019s BrewWorks, Pune \u2013 a popular microbrewery in the city.\n\u201cThe craft beers are awesome to say the least on account of freshness, quality of ingredients (imported vs. domestic), and a fuller offering in terms of variants \u2013 from Lagers to Ales; Blondes, to Hafeweissen (wheat), Bock, Dunkel , Kolsh etc. The myriad styles that can be made available is so huge that there is no need for anyone to copy anyone and still give the consumers enough variety,\u201d he adds.\nMumbai has another interesting story to tell. \nSuketu Talekar (right),\n Co-Founder of Doolally, shares, \u201cInterestingly, as a brewery we have noticed a considerable increase in the number of people wanting to know what sits in their glass. Our brewmaster, Oliver Schauf will tell you that he has given more brewery tours in Pune, than in any other country (Germany, Finland, Russia) he has brewed in. People are not drinking beer and endorsing the taste \u2013 they are curious to know it\u2019s history and science behind each brew. There are more conversations around beer \u2013 people are curious \u2013 and that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\nMessage in a bottle\nDespite the growing craft beer movement, one might be tempted to ask if bottled beer still continues to rule the roost.\u00a0So who is really winning the battle? Is it the mug or the bottle? Talekar laughs, \u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s the customer! We keep saying this, it\u2019s a really great time to be a beer drinker in India. Not only are there a bunch of microbreweries in Mumbai, Pune, Gurgaon, Bangalore, creating and crafting beers like never before, but there are also some great imported bottled beers available in the country today. This is not something that was happening 5 years ago. We were all very happy drinking tasteless lagers, aren\u2019t we? It\u2019s great that the tyranny of bad beer is over. Well, almost.\u201d\n\u201cCraft beers are in a highly enviable spot relative to commercial beers. If commercial beers are X in terms of quality (palate feel, mouth feel), craft beers start at 4X! Now why would a discerning consumer not pay for quality? And once they have experienced the joys of craft beer, it will be extremely difficult for them to consume commercial beer,\u201d adds TJ.\nAccording to him, it is about making a better and more discerning choice. \u201cThe challenge I extend to many customers is that they should try craft beer from any brewery for the next 3 successive outings, and then try to revert to commercial beer \u2013 they will certainly struggle to fining 1 pint of any commercial beer! I\u2019m pretty certain of this outcome having been in this space for a little over 3 years. Consumers will eventually banish commercial beers from their repertoire, unless there is compulsion to drink it (availability of crafts, party where there is nothing but commercial beers)!!\u201d\nBest of both beers\nJain, who straddles between the bottled and craft beer segment, has a different story to share. \u201cDespite craft beer gaining traction, we are still at a stage where Kingfisher, Budweiser and Carlsberg are firmly entrenched in the mind-space of a consumer. The trend is shifting, albeit slowly, from being brand-driven to being taste-driven. Consumers are concerned a lot more about the overall drinking experience and thus micro-breweries will continue to play a relevant role in shaping the trends for the future. At Bira, we are trying to replicate the craft beer experience at home by packaging it in bottles. While craft beers are a recent phenomenon, clocking the response our craft beer has got in the past 12 weeks, it is highly likely that the trend will shift towards the predominance of craft beers in pubs and restaurants. However, bottled beer will continue to enjoy its share of glory \u2013 unless people start replacing bottled beer with kegs for the \u2018at-home\u2019 drinking occasion and step out for a freshly brewed mug every time they desire a beer.\u201d\nTJ summarizes, \u201cThe shift we are witnessing is huge \u2013 In premium bars/restaurants where we co-exist with commercial beers , we are beginning to take the lion\u2019s share of the beer category despite the price premium relative to commercial beers. The preference is certainly shifting like in the western world. Large brewers have paid a huge price in market share erosion and now scrambling to acquire some craft brewers to make them a part of their portfolio. This phenomenon will come to India sooner than in the west! Foreseeably, craft beers will garner at least 25% of the total category in the coming years.\u201d"

        "content": "It\u2019s around this time every year that we take a few moments to pause and look at the year gone by (mostly so we have enough to put into an anniversary blogpost). This time, the pause was a little longer than usual, because this has probably been our biggest growth year yet.\nUntil last July, we were serving 20 million visitors a month information for 200,000 restaurants across 12 countries. At the time, we\u2019d also just hit the 1000 mark in terms of team strength, and we thought that was quite something. Then the action began. Between July and December, we welcomed MenuMania, Lunchtime, Obedovat, Gastronauci, and Cibando into the Zomato family. In January this year, we acquired Urbanspoon to make our entry into the US and Australia markets. Overnight, our traffic grew 3x, the number of restaurants listed grew 7x, and the number of cities we cover crossed the 10,000 mark. In the same month, we acquired Mekanist to become the go-to restaurant search and discovery product in Turkey, one of our fastest-growing markets. January was also a busy month for us \u2013 we raised another $50 million to fuel our rapid growth, and brought MaplePOS and NexTable into the fold.\nOn the product front, we\u2019ve grown tremendously. We\u2019ve gone beyond being just a consumer-focused restaurant search and discovery service, and are moving closer by the day to being the single platform that enables all interactions between consumers and restaurants. In September last year, we launched our Zomato for Business product to enable restaurant businesses worldwide to connect and engage with their customers. February this year saw the launch of our Cashless payments product in Dubai, allowing diners to eat and walk out of restaurants without having to wait for a physical bill. In April, we piloted our Online Ordering service in select metros in India, and will soon be rolling it out to many more locations in India and abroad. In the next couple of months, we\u2019ll be rolling out Zomato Book \u2013 our table reservations product, and Zomato Base \u2013 our point-of-sale product for businesses. There are even bigger things happening on the product front \u2013 we will reveal everything when it is ready.\n\u2013\nSo here we stand today, seven years young, over 2000 Zomans strong, raring to get started with year #8. We want to say a big thanks to everyone who\u2019s made this possible: the folks who use Zomato. We couldn\u2019t have done it without your encouragement and feedback, and we hope we\u2019ll keep getting plenty of both as we continue to grow.\nHere\u2019s to an amazing 7 years so far, and plenty more to come in our mission to ensure nobody has a bad meal ever again."

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "We\u2019ve been getting tons of feedback since we switched Urbanspoon to Zomato, and some of the things have really got us thinking. We took a step back to take a good look at our product, and found there were some fundamental issues that needed to be addressed. The Zomato app, we noticed, had become complicated and unintuitive for our users over time. So we decided to go back to the drawing board to make Zomato as simple as we always intended it to be, without sacrificing any of the app\u2019s basic functionality.\nThe result of that is the simplest yet most powerful version of our app yet, and this is only the starting point. Here\u2019s a look at all that\u2019s changed.\nThe first thing we did was to condense functionally similar navigation tabs and organise the app into just two sections \u2013 Restaurants, and Profile \u2013 instead of the earlier five. Now, the Restaurants tab has everything that helps speed up and simplify deciding where to eat. The \nSearch \nsection now has a prominent map at the top, along with quick-search filters for breakfast, lunch, dinner, delivery, and more. You can still open up the map, pan to another area, and draw to search for results in that particular area. \nDelivery\n and \nNearby\n restaurants get dedicated buttons on the home screen, putting search results a single tap away. Our \nCollections \nnow also have a new look and feel, with larger cards and one tweak that saves you a few clicks each time \u2013 you can see the restaurant closest to you without having to open and scroll through an entire collection \ud83d\ude42\nWith this update, we\u2019ve also focused on improving the discovery aspect of the app. We\u2019ve split the \nFood Feed\n into a \nLocal Feed\n, where you can discover local foodies and see where they\u2019re eating, and \nMy Feed\n, where you\u2019ll see stories from people you\u2019re following. You will now also get \nContextual Recommendations\n, with suggestions based on your past dining behaviour and current location. These recommendations will become smarter and more personalised over time, but it should still help you (re)discover some great places you may not have thought of otherwise.\nWe\u2019ve also moved three key features to the app\u2019s homepage, because we found they were a tad difficult to access in the previous version: \nSuggest a Restaurant\n, \nRecently Viewed\n, and \nBookmarks\n. Your Bookmarks are now also easier to navigate, with options to sort by distance or how recently they were added, single-tap filters to show places that are open now or to hide places you\u2019ve already been to, as well as the option to filter them by location.\nMoving on to the Profile section, you\u2019ll notice two things \u2013 the section is a lot cleaner, and that the Food Journey is now called the Dineline. To make the Profile section easier to get around, we kept all the primary information such as profile stats, notifications, and Dineline on the main profile page, and moved all the secondary information into a side drawer that slides out with a single tap.\n\u2013\nThis is a huge update to the app, but it\u2019s just the starting point, and there are plenty more improvements to come. And as always, we will look forward to your feedback (especially if you moved over from Urbanspoon). Please email us at \nfeedback@zomato.com\n if you have \nanything\n to say about this update."

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "Millions of people globally use Zomato every day to decide where to eat. While location and cost are factors a lot of folks consider, a restaurant\u2019s rating also plays a role in one deciding whether or not to eat there. Given that it plays such a central role, we feel it\u2019s important that a restaurant\u2019s rating should be representative of the experiences people have had at that establishment.\nOn Urbanspoon, restaurants had an absolute rating system based on the percentage of people \u2018Liking\u2019 a restaurant. So if 80 out of 100 people \u2018Liked\u2019 a restaurant and 20 down-voted it, the restaurant\u2019s score would be 80% \u2013 not taking into account the people who may not have enjoyed their experience there. This also makes restaurants vulnerable to spam ratings from unverified users, which can have an adverse effect on a restaurant\u2019s percentage score.\nZomato uses a 5-point classroom-style grading model, where the distribution of scores in every city is normalized, resulting in ratings in each city being distributed over a normal curve. Additionally, a user\u2019s credibility on Zomato \u2013 calculated by an algorithm based on the user\u2019s activity \u2013 also affects how much their rating will affect a restaurant\u2019s overall rating. This means a restaurant with a very high percentage score (let\u2019s say 96%) on Urbanspoon won\u2019t have a directly proportionate rating (4.8 in this case) on Zomato, because there are more factors at play than a simple \u2018Like\u2019.\n\u2018Likes\u2019 and \u2018Dislikes\u2019 from Urbanspoon have been migrated to Zomato as well, and appear as \u2018Positive\u2019 or \u2018Negative\u2019 labels on reviews, corresponding to users\u2019 up-votes and down-votes. We\u2019re encouraging migrated Urbanspoon users to add ratings to their votes, which will count towards the overall rating of the restaurants they\u2019ve visited, so there might be a minor increase or decrease in restaurants\u2019 overall ratings over time.\nUsing a normalized distribution method for restaurants also helps prevent restaurants in a city from getting clustered in the mid-range of the 5-point scale. It also lets people comparing two restaurants decide which one they think is \u2018better\u2019 \u2013 something we all do a lot of when picking a place to eat. The goal is to make things easy for the user to relate to \u2013 which we hope we have been able to achieve here.\nWe would love hear thoughts from Urbanspoon users and restaurants owners over at \nfeedback@zomato.com"

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "We\u2019ve been working hard over the past few months to merge the Urbanspoon website and mobile apps into Zomato, and the integrated product is finally here. Urbanspoon is becoming Zomato for good, and while all restaurant and user information has been migrated over from Urbanspoon to Zomato, a few things look and work differently. Here\u2019s a rundown of what\u2019s changed.\nThe rating system\n. Urbanspoon had a Like/Dislike voting system, but Zomato uses a 5-point rating scale. Percentage scores from Urbanspoon have been translated into 5-point scores on Zomato, and Likes/Dislikes from users\u2019 profiles have been moved over to Zomato as \u2018Positive\u2019 and \u2018Negative\u2019.\nThe review system\n. Zomato allows only one review per user per restaurant. Why? We believe that the most recent experience you\u2019ve had at a restaurant is the most relevant one. Multiple reviews for the same restaurant from Urbanspoon have been merged into one, broken down by date of submission. These can easily be edited to reflect the most recent experience you\u2019ve had at that restaurant.\nChoice. Lots of it!\n Adding to all the existing locations on Urbanspoon, you can now explore restaurants in 22 countries (and counting) globally. There are over 1 million restaurants to choose from in 10,000+ cities, so the Zomato app is a trusted companion to take with you on holiday.\nYour personal Food Journey\n. This timeline helps you keep track of all the places you eat at, with chronologically sorted reviews, photos, and check-ins. Scroll through it anytime you want to relive your foodie memories (or if the name of that amazing place you ate at a few months ago eludes you). Another change you\u2019ll notice on your Food Journey is that check-ins from your Dineline appear as \u2018Been There\u2019 on Zomato.\nWishlists and Favorites\n. All Wishlists and Favorites have been moved to Zomato as Bookmarks, which you can find on your profile page. On the desktop site, Bookmarks can be filtered by city so you know what\u2019s around you, and find what you\u2019re looking for even quicker.\nSpoonbacks\n. This one\u2019s for all the bloggers. While Spoonbacks are still active, Zomato requires blog posts to be published manually, and a rating to be added to each one, before posts can appear on restaurant pages. And since we\u2019re firm believers in pictures being worth a thousand words, you can also attach photos to your posts and tag friends you were dining with before publishing. If you\u2019re a blogger and want to get started posting on Zomato, \nhead here\n.\nLeaderboards\n. Leaderboards on Zomato help identify the most prolific contributors in a city. A review or blog post on Zomato earns 25 points, while every photo uploaded earns 2. Leaderboard positions are earned (and defended) depending on points earned in the past six months. We also have a separate leaderboard for bloggers, and one\u2019s position on that depends on how many restaurants one has written posts for with Spoonbacks.\nLogin-only apps\n. Unlike Urbanspoon, the Zomato app requires one to log in. The only reason we ask for this, is to be able to personalize and customize the product experience. This includes trusted recommendations from friends and Bookmarks for easy access. And since this has been a point of concern, we take security and personal information seriously, and will \nnever\n share/sell information to anyone, ever.\nEverything\u2019s also already available on the Zomato mobile apps, which you can download for\n iOS\n,\n Android\n, and\n Windows Phone\n. In addition to the features we\u2019ve already told you about, the apps also give you one-tap access to nearby restaurants, a cool draw-to-search map, and beautifully designed Collections. You can also check in at restaurants, tag friends, and add photos and reviews while on the move. You\u2019ll also notice a couple of features aren\u2019t available anymore, such as the shake-to-search feature and Guides, but there\u2019s a whole lot more to explore with maps and Collections.\nIf you\u2019re using Zomato for the first time, welcome aboard! Take the apps and website for a spin, and if you have any questions or feedback for us along the way, we\u2019re listening. Please don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch with us at\n feedback@zomato.com\n anytime at all.\nHappy dining!"

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/introducing-zomato-order/",
        "author": "namitaz-blog",
        "content": "After weeks of building, intensive testing, and rebuilding, our online ordering service \u2013 Zomato Order \u2013 is finally good to go. This signals our second significant add-on feature, following the rollout of Zomato Cashless earlier this year. Somewhere along the process of testing and rebuilding, and the hundreds of feedback emails we received, we realized we had to make a decision we were trying to put off for as long as possible \u2013 unbundling our apps.\nGiven that we\u2019ve always focused on condensing tons of information into a ridiculously easy-to-use app, this might seem to be a departure from that mission. Quite the contrary. Here\u2019s why we are doing what we are doing.\nMore focus = less clutter = better UX\n. Having two separate apps allows us to build lightweight apps that get straight to solving the problems you face. Actions that are core to the app experience can be given priority of position, and we aren\u2019t forced into making real estate compromises. For example, tracking your Order Status in the Zomato restaurant finder app requires a few taps; on the Order app, it gets its own tab. This might be the first time we\u2019ll be happier with shorter app session times \ud83d\ude42\nIndependent release cycles = fewer updates\n. While they might be part of one complete dining flow, using Zomato to search for a place to eat, and using Zomato to order online are two independent use cases for our users. Baking the ordering feature into the restaurant finder app might seem like the convenient thing to do, but that means having to coincide release cycles for two effectively different products in one. Unbundling them allows us to devote attention to both apps independently, iterate quickly, and push updates for either one as required. It\u2019ll also mean that the restaurant finder app isn\u2019t weighed down by extra lines of code in markets where online ordering isn\u2019t available yet.\nDeep-linking = smoother app experience\n. As is the case with most unbundled apps that come to mind, the Zomato restaurant finder app and Zomato Order will be linked to one another. So if you\u2019ve found a place you want to order from on the restaurant finder app, a single tap will take you to that restaurant on the Order app, and you can proceed to add items to your cart. Once done, a single tap will take you back to the restaurant finder app, so you can decide what to do for your next meal (obviously).\nThe downside for our foodies is that it\u2019ll be an additional download, but that\u2019s a one-time effort (and we\u2019ll still be running lighter than other food ordering apps out there). Additional win for foodies on iOS: as and when there are more apps in the Zomato suite, they can all be downloaded as a bundle from the App Store.\nIn short, the long-term benefit of unbundling our apps seems to outweigh the short-term downside, and we think it\u2019ll help make the process of using Zomato \u2013 whether it\u2019s for search and discovery, or for ordering online \u2013 a simpler and smoother process for everyone.\nZomato Order\n is now available for download on the \nApp Store\n and the \nPlay Store\n."

Which is exactly what\n [redacted]\n from our Lebanon team did.\nEXCEPT, she accidentally sent a selfie that was meant to go to someone else (guess who?)\u2026to the entire team (though she did try to create a story that sounded even somewhat plausible).\nThe picture (obviously) warranted a reply. And the rest of Zomato Lebanon wasted no time getting in on the fun \u2013 even from their cars\u2026\n\u2026which was the origin of team Lebanon\u2019s new policy: If you\u2019re unwell, you\u2019ve got to prove it:\nSo as far as milestones in the history of the selfie go:\n2013\n \u2013 the word \u201cselfie\u201d was the Oxford English Dictionary\u2019s Word of the Year.\n2014\n \u2013 Ellen DeGeneres\u2019 Oscar selfie got more than 3 million retweets.\n2015\n \u2013 The selfie becomes the (un)official way to call in sick at Zomato.\nThis new tradition of sick-selfies will undoubtedly be passed on from one Zoman to the next. Whether these pictures succeed in simply putting a smile on the team\u2019s face for a few seconds, or help them bond in a moment they share, small things like these do their bit to shape the culture of a company. The workplace slowly becomes an experience bound by fun and friendship. And being sick can actually be a \nlittle\n less depressing.\nP.S. In case you were wondering, this \nisn\u2019t\n an official policy. We\u2019re probably just too fun for our own good."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/defining-great-in-recruiting/",
        "author": "sobbisen",
        "content": "According to us, \ngreat\n organisations drive growth by hiring \ngreat\n people who do \ngreat\n work. This growth creates further opportunities for the organisation to bring in more \ngreat\n people. These people, in turn, create even more growth for the organisation. Repeat.\nWe\u2019ve used the word \ngreat\n five times so far, but \u2013 what does \u2018great\u2019 \nreally\n mean? For any organisation, before you start hiring people who will drive your growth, it is necessary to define your benchmark of \ngreat\n. Then, you need to identify, sell to, and bring in these \ngreat\n\u00a0people to join your organisation. For early-stage startups, founders should be doing (and actually do) most of the hiring. But at scale, that doesn\u2019t scale, so you need to build a recruiting team that will ensure a continuous flow of \ngreat\n into the organisation. Overall, any recruiting team\u2019s role has two primary parts \u2013 Selling and Buying. In that order. Let\u2019s zoom into both these parts for a bit.\nSelling\nThe recruitment team is first supposed to make the person you are talking to for a potential role in your organisation \nwant\n to join your organisation. So, a recruiter\u2019s role is to \u201csell\u201d \nthree\n things to the other person: the vision, the role, and the organisation\u2019s values. \nGreat\n recruiters \nhave\n to embody the values of the organisation. It should be clearly visible in their actions and behaviour \u2013 from the first shake of hands to the last \u2013 because first impressions are also almost always the last. At the end of this process, the other person should really buy into what you are doing, and should want to join you.\nBuying\nOnce the person is sold on the organisation, the recruiter becomes a buyer and is supposed to \u201cbuy\u201d \ntwo\n things \u2013 culture fit, and skill fit. In that order. If your definition of \ngreat\n\u00a0is the right one, you should be saying no to more people on the basis of culture than on the basis of skill.\nThe reality is that \ngreat\n people aren\u2019t just going to walk in. Someone needs to reach out to them, share the dream, and get them to be a part of your organisation. Only a \ngreat\n recruitment team can make this possible. But \u2013 circular reference alert \u2013 what makes a \ngreat\n recruiter?\nA recruiter has to be a \ngreat\n seller, as well as a \ngreat\n buyer; most people are only good at one of the two. This means a recruiter\u2019s job is more complex than most others, because s/he needs to be \ngreat\n\u00a0at \nboth\n these things. It also means that a recruitment team is the most difficult one to build, and is something you should build before you start building the rest of the organisation.\nTraditionally, recruitment is seen as a buyer-seller transaction where the seller (the candidate) must prove themselves to the buyer (the recruiter) by navigating through interviews. That\u2019s a load of bulls**t. The way you should think about recruitment is anything but traditional. Think of it as courtship. Both the organisation (the recruiting team) and the person have to fall in love with each other. Otherwise, the outcome is going to be a relationship that\u2019s anything but \ngreat\n.\n#plug If you feel you are a \ngreat\n recruiter, please write in to me at s@zomato.com. We are looking for \ngreatness\n across the globe."

The product will now be called\n Zomato Base\n, and information on the product is now available at\n zomato.com/base\n.\nBase is an incredibly functional Android-based POS system that uses custom hardware for a more reliable and flexible product experience. It offers restaurants features such as menu and inventory management, and has a built-in payment solution to accept debit and credit card payments. This acquisition takes us a step closer to providing end-to-end tech to the restaurant industry. In an industry that has seen very little technology penetration so far, we\u2019re excited to be driving this change at a large scale.\nZomato Base will be topped with features such as Menu Management, Inventory Management, Recipe Management, Customer Relationship Management, Data Analytics, Electronic Receipts, Offline Transaction Support, Payment Gateway Integration and a stealth feature that will change the way restaurants go about their business (watch this space for details).\nWe\u2019re probably the only food-tech company in the world that is building products for consumers as well as restaurant businesses. There is a lot that can be done if we are able to build a technology platform that connects consumers to restaurants and vice versa, and we believe that a world-class cloud-based POS system is the first step towards building that platform. \nMaplePOS is a great point-of-sale product, and the team \u2013 Arun, Varun, and Abhishek \u2013 have done a great job to give it shape. We\u2019re excited about working with them to build this further and realize our dream of building the best and most widely adopted restaurant point of sale system in the world. \nWe\u2019ll be working on integrating Base\u2019s services into our consumer products over the next few months, and restaurant businesses across the world will be able to harness the power of Zomato Base this fall."

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "Since our last major product update in April 2014, we\u2019ve added over 450 cities across 11 countries, and have always actively asked for feedback from our foodies across the globe to work towards creating the best restaurant search experience possible. Of the thousands who have obliged, one recurring point that\u2019s emerged has been about too many restaurants being clustered within a small rating range. Until now, restaurant ratings were being determined by a weighted average of absolute scores, which resulted in this clustering within a range. But what foodies really want is to be able to compare two restaurants to decide which one is a \u2018better\u2019 destination. The only way to solve this is by moving from an absolute rating to a more classroom-style grading model, where the distribution of scores in every city on Zomato is normalized, resulting in ratings in each city being distributed over a normal curve.\nAs illustrated in the example below, the earlier system (the orange line) put over 50% of the restaurants in the range of 3.2 to 3.5, which doesn\u2019t really help one decide which restaurant is \u2018better\u2019.\nOnce the absolute rating curve has been flattened to create a comparative distribution curve (the red line), fewer than 30% of the restaurants will fall within the 3.2 \u2013 3.5 range. We\u2019ve also cleared out a lot of spam based on improvements in our spam-control filters, so there\u2019s less noise getting in the way when you\u2019re trying to decide where to eat. \nThere are plenty more features and improvements on the way and, as always, we\u2019d love to know if you have any suggestions for things you feel we could/should be doing differently."

        "content": "So you want to be a Zoman? If you\u2019ve done your homework, you\u2019ve probably read a fair bit about us, our work culture, and how we function as a company. I thought I\u2019d give you a little insight \u2013 from a personal perspective \u2013 into what it\u2019s really like on the inside. Especially if you\u2019d like to be one of us.\n1. We\u2019re still a startup.\n Sure, we\u2019re over a thousand people strong already, and across 22 countries. But, that doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re still a startup because of the way we think and work. We have the same focus and hustle that we did when Zomato was Foodiebay and was functioning out of a living room. More often than not, it means unpredictable work hours, tight deadlines, moving targets, and ambiguity. It also means working weekends, missing out on social commitments, and counting the espresso machine among your close friends. But it\u2019s all about identifying what matters more in the longer term and prioritizing accordingly.\n2. You learn how to swim.\n Back in September 2013, I was moved from the marketing team, the shallow end of the pool, to the product team, the deep end of the pool. The \nvery\n deep end. It meant being surrounded by, and working with, incredibly gifted engineers and designers. The closest thing to engineering I\u2019d done was building stuff with LEGO, and the first time I heard \u2018json\u2019, all I could think of was Friday the 13th. But the choices are simple \u2013 you learn to swim, or sink. I\u2019m still a long way from making it to the Olympics, but boy \u2013 am I loving swimming!\n3. It isn\u2019t always rainbows and unicorns.\n It might sound fairly obvious, but it\u2019s important to remember that you will routinely be pushed out of your comfort zone. That can be scary, especially when you know there\u2019s a lot depending on you. There might even be the one-off days where it feels like you can\u2019t deal with it. But as Calvin Coolidge said \u2013 nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. It might be easier said than done, but you need to stay focused and push on. You\u2019ll come out better prepared for tougher situations, and begin to enjoy life at the edge of your comfort zone. You\u2019ll be surprised by how often you surprise yourself.\n4. We get restless when things slow down. \nIf you know anyone who\u2019s already a Zoman, you probably also know how passionate we are about what we do. Even annoyingly so, sometimes (just ask my friends). There\u2019s a good reason for that. We set massive goals for ourselves, then we set out to achieve them, which means we\u2019re running hard most of the time. In fact, we start worrying when there aren\u2019t a million things to do. Read back to the first point \u2013 it\u2019s hard work, and it\u2019s the first thing anyone will tell you about life at Zomato. But as Confucius summed it up, choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.\n5. You add a new branch to your family tree.\n \u201cThere are no strangers here, only friends you haven\u2019t met\u201d couldn\u2019t possibly be truer than it is for us. You will build long-lasting friendships with some truly amazing people. In fact, we often joke that we live like doctors, in that our social group is more or less the same at work as it is outside. The best part? We love it like that. Not to mention the brilliant people we have spread across the globe. Personally, I think I\u2019ve made enough friends to ensure that I\u2019ll have someone to show me around in at least 21 countries \ud83d\ude42\n6. You get to be yourself.\n One of the many things we celebrate as an organisation is diversity. Not just the number of countries Zomans represent worldwide, but also what each of us brings to the table. We believe everyone has a unique set of skills, and that people who have the right stuff to be Zoman don\u2019t carry very much baggage. In fact, even your college degree doesn\u2019t strictly define what you do here. You\u2019ll find engineers in our sales team, finance majors in our operations team, and even (ahem) sociologists in marketing. In short, who you are matters waaay more than where you\u2019re from. You just need to have a fire raging in your belly and \nreally\n want to get shit done.\nIf you hadn\u2019t figured it out already, this is a not-so-subtle way to tell you that we\u2019re hiring, because we need some seriously amazing folks to join us across countries and functions for the next leg of our journey. This isn\u2019t everybody\u2019s cup of tea, and if this isn\u2019t what you want, you shouldn\u2019t be at Zomato. But if what you\u2019ve read excites you, check out our \ncareers page\n."

The only little extra effort for Urbanspoon users is that unlike Urbanspoon, they will need to log into the Zomato app to use it. However, once the migration is complete, you won\u2019t even need to do anything \u2013 an app update will swap out the apps on your phone and look like this:\nTo make the transition a little smoother, we want to start getting people used to the Zomato brand a few weeks before we completely switch the product. From today onwards, you will see \u2018Urbanspoon\u2019 changing to \u2018Zomato\u2019 across Urbanspoon\u2019s social media channels (Facebook, Twitter, \u00a0Instagram, and the other usual suspects), so don\u2019t be surprised when you see posts from a page you don\u2019t remember following! \ud83d\ude09\nWe\u2019re still a few weeks away from completely transitioning the product, so if you have suggestions for features you\u2019d like to see, we\u2019d love to hear them. \n[#ShamelessPlug] We\u2019re also hiring for a bunch of exciting roles across the world. Do check out \nour careers page\n if you want to be a part of this amazing journey."

        "content": "Describing the last month as exciting would be an understatement. We welcomed Urbanspoon to Zomato, and with our more recent acquisition of Mekanist, our focus has now shifted onto making all these great products come together.\u00a0\nIntegrating websites and apps always comes with its own set of challenges. In the Czech Republic, and Poland, language was one of the biggest. With Urbanspoon, it\u2019s the sheer scale of the information and the number of users we\u2019re going to be moving to Zomato. While pondering the smoothest way to go about this, we were also giving some serious thought to how our two brands come together, because that plays a huge role in the success of product integration.\u00a0\nUrbanspoon is one of the most recognized consumer internet brands in the United States, Canada, and Australia. By the time we merge the Urbanspoon website and apps into Zomato by March this year, two-thirds of our overall traffic will be coming from just these three countries. It\u2019s important to us that we don\u2019t lose a lot of Urbanspoon users by giving them a new name, a new logo, and a new product.\u00a0\nWith that in mind, we\u2019ve taken a call that\u2019ll help ease the transition \u2013 making the first point of interaction with the product a familiar one, by modifying our logo to that of Urbanspoon\u2019s Spoon logo. Zomato will now be using the Spoon in Zomato red (which our team has nicknamed Pomodoro), while we retain our name.\nYou\u2019re probably thinking that we\u2019re nuts to be doing this only a couple of months after releasing our Heart logo. But for us, this is a simple case of making sure that the transition (of merging Urbanspoon to Zomato) is the least painful for the most number of our users. We want to make sure that when we update the Urbanspoon app for millions of users, we don\u2019t give them a new name and a new icon. Doing that could make it look like they installed the Zomato app by mistake, potentially leading to a large number of uninstalls.\u00a0\nFor Zomato users, they get a new logo, but retain the name. Hopefully, that shouldn\u2019t give us a large number of uninstalls (not much was lost when we moved to the Heart logo a couple of months ago).\nWe have already begun trying to get Urbanspoon users used to the new red in their life. If you\u2019ve seen the Urbanspoon website recently, you\u2019ll notice that we have started using the red in the logo.\nThis is the first step of the migration, and you will now gradually see this new logo appearing in the upcoming Urbanspoon and Zomato app updates, as well as in other places online and offline.\nBy March, we hope to be in a position where Zomato users across the planet will be able to easily recognize this icon on their phones, and fire up the app to find restaurants lightning-quick. We understand this is going to be another change for all of you who have been using Zomato regularly; it\u2019s also the most painful for us \u2013 the cost and effort of changing our logo everywhere across the world is humongous. But overall, we really hope we\u2019ll be given another chance to familiarize ourselves with your home screens. We promise we won\u2019t ask you to do this again for a long time to come!\nAs always, if you have any ideas or feel we could be approaching the migration in a better way (from a product and brand standpoint), we\u2019d love to hear from you."

        "content": "\u2026we just acquired Urbanspoon.\n If the past year was anything to go by, we knew 2015 was going to be big in a lot of ways. And we honestly can\u2019t think of a bigger, better way to start the year.\n While we\u2019ve been able to bring some great contemporaries into the fold over the past few months, this one is different. For one, we spent most of our last round of funding on this acquisition \u2013 but we\u2019ve always believed that the edge of our comfort zone is where the magic happens.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nUrbanspoon has been a dominant player in the US, Canada and Australia for years now, and it\u2019s a great business that\u2019s been built on a solid foundation of exhaustive, rich local restaurant content. Everything they\u2019ve done has been powered by a fantastic team that shares our vision and core values, and brings a wealth of local knowledge and expertise to the table. As we stand here now, we felt joining forces with Urbanspoon would be the best way to turbocharge our growth and make our way into the US, Canada and Australia. Without question, this will also help us take significant strides forward in the markets we\u2019ve been sharing with Urbanspoon so far \u2013 the UK, Canada, New Zealand, and Ireland.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nNeedless to say, the road ahead is a long one, and there are big challenges to overcome. For one, we\u2019ll need to ensure that Urbanspoon\u2019s website and app are integrated into Zomato smoothly over the next couple of months, without sacrificing the usability or utility of either. Urbanspoon has built vast legions of faithful followers over the years, and we\u2019ll need to work extra hard to ensure that the finished product is one that users and merchants alike will love and enjoy using. \n Another challenge \u2013 usually our biggest \u2013 is going to be finding a bunch of people as crazy as we are to drive our operations in the US, Canada and Australia. We\u2019re very fortunate to be welcoming the Urbanspoon team into Zomato, which will be immensely valuable as we grow the forces in each of these countries. \n The biggest challenge and most fun part of this move, however, is the fight we\u2019re going to be picking with Yelp. In the market they have dominated for so long. After all, like Mark Twain famously said, it isn\u2019t the size of the dog in the fight, it\u2019s the size of the fight in the dog."

Stevenson\nWe\u2019re already in 2015, and to be very honest, we didn\u2019t expect to see the past year go by this quickly. But looking back, what a year it\u2019s been! We could probably spend many hours going over every little thing that\u2019s happened, but since we all have other things to do, let\u2019s focus on the (most) noteworthy ones.\nIn keeping with our aggressive global growth, we took Zomato to many new countries (and continents). Along the way, we welcomed five market-leading restaurant search players in Europe and New Zealand into the Zomato family. We also took the big step into North America with our Canada launch, and despite the presence of other established players, things are picking up quickly. Two of the biggest challenges that come with this kind of growth are making sure our product works well in all our markets, and finding the right team to make sure Zomato continues to grow at a sprint across the globe.\nOn the product front, our apps and website have grown in leaps and bounds. We introduced theme-based \nCollections\n, added restaurants \nCheck-ins\n to our apps, rolled out a new Expertise system, and added to the (growing) list of languages Zomato is available in. Every new market comes with its own product needs, and every launch has been a learning experience that\u2019s added more value to Zomato as a product. Looking at our launch pipeline, it\u2019s safe to say there will need to be plenty more steps in the evolution. But that\u2019s a challenge we\u2019re looking forward to.\nAlmost a year to the date since our last round of funding, we raised a \nfurther USD 60 million\n from Info Edge, Sequoia Capital, and our newest investors, Vy Capital. These funds will drive our growth plans dramatically, and let us take Zomato to even more people across the globe. We\u2019d like to thank our investors for their support and the belief they\u2019ve shown in us.\nLastly, and needless to say, none of this would have been possible without the constant encouragement and feedback we keep getting from you \u2013 the folks who use Zomato. Please keep telling us what we can do better, because we believe that\u2019s the only way we\u2019ll ever be able to truly change the way the world eats.\nWe\u2019ve spent 2014 gearing up for large-scale changes, and we can hardly wait to sink our teeth into all that lies ahead in 2015."

This gives us a great foundation on which to kickstart Zomato Italy, and bring the best of both products to users\u2019 and merchants\u2019 smartphones. We have an able leader in Guk Kim, who founded Cibando and will now be heading our operations in Italy.\nWe\u2019re looking forward to working with the team in Italy to merge Cibando into Zomato over the next couple of months, and grow to become the only restaurant search app Italy will ever need.

The initial signs with our acquisitions in the Czech Republic and Slovakia are very good, and we\u2019re very excited about building on top of a great product with a great local team, which adds a ton of energy to Zomato.\nThe Czech Republic and Slovakia were our first two launches in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE); with that underway, we started thinking about Poland, definitely the largest market for a product like ours in CEE. Poland is far ahead of a lot of countries when it comes to adopting and developing new technologies (and is sometimes also said to be innovating a lot more than good old Silicon Valley).\nGastronauci, the newest member of the Zomato family, has had an iron grip on the market in Poland and built great market and mindshare over the past 6 years. With the brand, and the associated network effect, Zomato will have a significant advantage (and head start) compared to our other competitors. We\u2019re not kidding when we say that Gastronauci was doing such a great job, it was a straightforward buy vs. no-go decision for us while evaluating our foray into Poland. They\u2019ve beaten the yell out of any competition coming out of the Valley, which is commendable.\nWe were always really excited about the Poland market, and Gastronauci joining us just makes the excitement more real. We\u2019re now eagerly looking forward to making Zomato Poland the de-facto restaurant guide in the country."

Now, we\u2019re going a step further, and building on the existing Zomato experience to make the in-restaurant experience smoother and easier.\u00a0\nIt starts with the Check In. Checking in at a restaurant now gives you handy tips from fellow foodies, suggestions on what to order, and also lets you add a picture or a review for that restaurant incredibly easily.\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s even better than checking in at a restaurant, you ask? Checking in\u00a0\nwith\n\u00a0friends! You can now tag friends in check-ins, reviews, and photo comments, so you\u2019ll always remember who you celebrated that promotion with. Without saying too much, we\u2019ll tell you that the check-in is just the first step in a series of great new related features to come. Just a note of playful caution: Zomato is not a game, so just don\u2019t expect any (ahem) official-sounding titles if you keep checking in at places across the city.\nSpeaking of places across the city, we understand it can be quite difficult to remember all the restaurants you\u2019ve eaten at, or when you went to a particular one. With the completely redesigned Food Journey, you can now track every single foodie moment \u2013 the photos you added, the reviews you wrote, and now even check-ins \u2013 right from the time you signed up on Zomato, up until the meal you just finished.\nOne more important thing we\u2019re sure you\u2019ll notice the moment you open the app, is how different it looks and feels. Images load 6x faster than before, the home screen is easier to read, and even restaurant pages have been redesigned so things are just where you\u2019ll need them. For example, the things that foodies on Zomato access the most \u2013 menus, reviews, and pictures \u2013 are conveniently located at the top half of the page. Supporting information such as dish suggestions, what a restaurant is known for, timings, and cuisines are at the bottom half. Essentially, we\u2019re on a mission to make things as simple as we possibly can for anyone deciding where to eat. That\u2019s also why your Wishlist and SpeedDial \u2013 now rolled into a single list known as Bookmarks \u2013 can be accessed offline as well (so you\u2019re at nobody\u2019s mercy when the WiFi\u2019s down and you need to order in).\nLast, but definitely not the least, Zomato is also compatible with iOS8. In addition to several overall performance improvements, we\u2019ll be baking in some of their features in future updates. For now, you can use interactive notifications to follow foodies back from within the notification at the top of your screen, without leaving what you were doing.\u00a0\nAll these changes should go a long way in simplifying the way we eat. And like we said, there\u2019s still so much more to come, including our Android, Windows Phone, and website updates, which are headed your way\u00a0\nvery\n\u00a0soon.\nWe\u2019re always looking for feedback, so we know what we need to be doing better. We\u2019d love it if you took the app for a spin, and sent us your thoughts \u2013 we\u2019re at\u00a0\nfeedback@zomato.com\n, and always listening on\u00a0\ntwitter\n. Oh, and if you haven\u2019t already heard, we\u2019re giving away an iPhone 6 for the most brutally open \u2013 but constructive \u2013 public feedback we get for our apps and website. You might want to\u00a0\ncheck it out\n\u00a0\u2013 because those food pictures will look\u00a0\nso\n\u00a0much better on that 4.7-inch screen."

We took a step towards that with our last major product update by introducing Collections that catered to a variety of local tastes, ranging from Afternoon Tea in London to Artisanal Coffee in Manila, as well as popular themes that work across locations, such as Romantic and Outdoor restaurants.\nIt\u2019s fair to say that some people in a city know the best it has to offer \u2013 whether it\u2019s a tiny coffee shop tucked away in a back-alley, a Chinese restaurant that delivers 24\u00d77, or even a newly opened restaurant that does the best spaghetti carbonara in town. So now, to share even more of that local knowledge, we\u2019re introducing \nNeighborhood\n \nExperts\n.\nBecoming an Expert needs you to know your city and its various neighborhoods inside-out \u2013 and we\u2019re not just talking the popular restaurants and the hotspots that everyone already knows about. We mean \nreally\n knowing the best places to find anything a fellow foodie might be looking to dig into. \n To be able to boast a snazzy Expert badge on your profile, you need to:\nwrite 10 great reviews of restaurants in a single neighborhood.\npost 50 photos of restaurants in that same neighborhood (they\u2019ll all need to be tagged to restaurants in that neighborhood to count)\nIn case you\u2019re wondering how a neighborhood is defined, it\u2019s written just adjacent to the name of the restaurant on a restaurant page (it\u2019s also the area mentioned at the start of the address on the restaurant page):\u00a0\nAs you conquer neighborhoods, you\u2019ll get badges on your profile that announce you as an Expert in those areas:\u00a0\nThe best part? There\u2019s no limit on how many neighborhoods you can be an Expert in, and your expertise is valid forever once you\u2019ve earned it. \n With the introduction of Experts, you\u2019re going to notice one little difference \u2013 we won\u2019t have city-level leaderboards anymore. Given the way the Expert system is structured, you get to share your valuable foodie knowledge across an even wider area (literally), while still engaging in a little healthy competition with your friends to see who conquers a shared neighborhood first. We\u2019re working to make \nbeing\n an Expert even more valuable, because we envision a world where every neighborhood has an Expert who isn\u2019t just passionate about food, but also has the best food stories to tell.\n So here\u2019s to you, Experts!"

We\u2019re delighted to announce that \nLunchtime\n and \nObedovat\n, the largest lunch menu websites in the Czech Republic and Slovakia respectively, are \nnow a part of Zomato\n.\u00a0\nOver the course of building up our European operations, we\u2019ve observed that lunch menus are key to the dining behavior in the Central and Eastern European region. With lunch menus for over 5000 restaurants in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Lunchtime and Obedovat provide us with a great platform onto which we can build Zomato\u2019s features. More importantly, we\u2019re joining forces with teams that resonate with our cultural values, have invaluable insights and experience in the local markets, and are as passionate as we are about helping people find great places to grab a bite or a drink. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time getting to know the founding teams of both companies, and we\u2019re really excited about our collaborative potential.\nTogether, we\u2019ll be able to build the largest restaurant information resource in the region \u2013 going beyond just lunch menus \u2013 so you\u2019re spoiled for choice whether it\u2019s breakfast, lunch, or dinner. To keep things running smoothly, and offering the best of both worlds to users and merchants alike, we\u2019ll be gradually integrating Lunchtime and Obedovat into Zomato over the coming weeks. This approach worked beautifully for us when \nwe welcomed\n New Zealand\u2019s MenuMania into the fold, and we\u2019ll be looking to carry it across to some of the upcoming markets in our pipeline.\nFor now, we\u2019d just like to say a big welcome and \nna zdrav\u00ed\n to the newest members of the Zomato family."

        "content": "As American food writer Mary Fisher rightly said, \u201cFirst we eat, then we do everything else\u201d. It\u2019s fair to say all of us spend a good part of our lives trying to answer the \u201cwhere should I go to eat (or drink ;)) today?\u201d question. At Zomato, we\u2019d like to believe that we\u2019ve spoilt you for choice more often than not with our exhaustive coverage of restaurants. In the version of Zomato that we released last month, we made a mistake by looking at the wrong data set and taking out the \u201cTop trending restaurants\u201d section on Zomato. What followed was a deluge of emails asking why we removed this feature. That got us wondering about what we\u2019d got wrong. We realised that a lot of our users open Zomato with no idea about what to search for. They just want to go out, and have a good time. This is where the \u201cTop trending restaurants\u201d kicked in. It was a list of popular restaurants in town \u2014 something that helped our users browse and decide quickly. We also took a deep dive into popular search queries on Zomato, which revealed that users look for very specific\u00a0\ntypes\n\u00a0of places to go \u2014 for example, you might be wondering where to take your significant other for a romantic dinner, or where you can find a microbrewery to beat the heat. So we\u00a0decided to take the solution to this need gap a notch further by giving you a starting point based on popular themes and occasions, instead of you having to structure your thoughts into a search query. From today,\u00a0\nCollections\n\u00a0have you covered if you find yourself staring at the search bar not knowing what to search for.\nFrom ravioli to romance\nCollections are bite-sized lists of restaurants in your city that cover various themes and occasions to make deciding where to go easier than ever. We\u2019ve worked hard to create Collections based on each city\u2019s unique flavours as well as seasonal trends. For example, you can\u00a0gorge on the\u00a0\nbest burgers London\n\u00a0has to offer,\u00a0find\u00a0\npet-friendly restaurants\n\u00a0in Bangalore that\u2019ll let you bring a furry friend along, or even have your tastebuds seduced by a master-chef at one of the\u00a0\ncelebrity chef restaurants\n\u00a0in Dubai.\u00a0The restaurants you see in Collections are picked by our intelligent algorithm, and then vetted by our in-house team of foodie ninjas to ensure only the tastiest get through.\nLooks great, tastes better\nCollections package the best your city has to offer into a simple, visually engaging experience. To showcase these great restaurants, we\u2019ve designed a new card-based browsing experience on our apps that will keep you flipping through Collections for more! When something catches your eye, tuck it into your Wishlist for future deliciousness.\nCollections are available on both, our website, as well as on our mobile apps across iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. So whether you\u2019re planning to laze at a\u00a0\nbeach bar in Lisbon\n, or you\u2019re stuck in Mumbai traffic\u00a0\ndreaming about cupcakes\n, inspiration is always within reach. So go on, give Collections a nibble, and feed your fancy."

        "content": "The last 24 hours have been eventful for us, to say the least. We started off with the aim of putting Zomato in front of the awesome tech talent in Bangalore, but seems like it touched more nerves than hearts. In hindsight, we made one elementary mistake with this campaign \u2013 we took the ability to laugh at ourselves for granted. It hurt some feelings, and we are truly sorry for that.\nWhat we thought was a cheeky dig at Bangalore spiralled into something we never imagined. We\u2019ve seen all kinds of allegations flying around, and it was helped in no small part by the stereotype jokes on the parody of our original page (it has also been removed by its creator). Since the focus of the campaign has shifted a few hundred miles off course, we thought we should clarify a few things.\n1. This was just a hiring campaign to attract the right talent, and not to offend, outrage, degrade, stereotype, or do any of the terrible things that have been claimed. We\u2019re crazy, not stupid \ud83d\ude42\n2. We\u2019ve said it before, and we\u2019re happy to say it many times over. We love Bangalore, and we have absolutely nothing against the city or its people. In fact, this campaign wouldn\u2019t have seen the light of day if not for the awesome tech talent there. We also admit we\u2019re slightly jealous that Bangalore has better weather through the year,\n\u00a0\nand\n\u00a0\ngot to enjoy Metallica.\n3. None of the parody pages doing the rounds were created by us or anyone affiliated with Zomato. To the creators of those pages \u2013 hats off for the effort, but no thanks for the unwarranted sh*t it piled on us, because people thought that we created\n\u00a0\nthose\n\u00a0\npages too.\nWhile we totally understand that this might have been a troll too far, some of the things that were said were mind-numbing. The suggestions that we\u2019re trying to create a racial divide in the country, or that we have anything against people from any part of the country, were disappointing. We were absolutely taken aback by people reacting with rape and crime posts; that was completely uncalled for. We admit we got the campaign wrong this time, but to those who gave it a racist, rapist or criminal tone \u2013 we are sorry, we are not with you. All said and done, we now know that campaigns like this one probably need more than five opinions before going live. And even though we\u2019ve been getting some great applications, we\u2019ve pulled the campaign down in the hope that it\u2019ll put an end to the confusion."

        "content": "Over the past few years, finding and hiring the right people to grow our team has been a little like looking for a needle in a haystack. As our team grew (now 650 people strong, up from 140 this time last year) along with our global aspirations, we were faced with an interesting situation \u2013 a lot of the people we wanted to have on board weren\u2019t actually looking for jobs.\nFor the longest time, we\u2019ve considered job portals as the most dependable platform from which to source talent. These are people looking for companies, and companies in turn, looking for people. \u00a0In other words, \u2018active talent\u2019. But what about passive talent i.e. people who aren\u2019t actively looking to make a move? There could be a variety of reasons they\u2019re in this bracket:\n1. They don\u2019t have the time\n: Anyone who\u2019s hunted for a job will tell you it isn\u2019t an overnight process. Identifying a role that excites you enough is time-consuming. Then there are interviews and other formalities that follow. If someone loves what they\u2019re doing, they probably won\u2019t take the time out to look for a switch until they feel a desperate need for it.\n2. They\u2019re not aware of the options\n: As a startup, there\u2019s probably a lot more excitement and growth one can offer to a candidate than a large corporate can. But if one isn\u2019t looking actively, it\u2019s likely they won\u2019t dig deep enough to explore possibilities.\n3. They don\u2019t know you are an option\n: There\u2019s a fair chance that the people who might fit nicely into your system are big fans and active users of your product. But it\u2019s equally likely that they don\u2019t see you as a potential employer, because there\u2019s no precedent in their peer group.\n4. They simply haven\u2019t given it any thought\n: To describe it in a word: inertia. This is a combination of the first two points \u2013 some people might just be in their current job because they haven\u2019t bothered giving it a second thought, even if discontent and boredom are creeping in. If you can show them what they could be missing (especially at a startup), they might sit up and take notice.\nHalf the job is done when you have identified the issue. Now, how do you find such people? Here are some lessons/tips/tricks from our hiring experiences over the past few months:\nYour users are the best people to put this question to. Be shameless in telling people who like your product and use it often that you are hiring. We almost always have a prominent hiring message on the website and have a steady stream of applications coming in every day. Previously, they just didn\u2019t know it was an option for them. Also, use your social media strength to spread the word that you are hiring.\nNetwork, and then network some more\n: Be passive aggressive with networking. Incentivise your employees to tap into their networks. Then their friends\u2019 networks and their friends\u2019 network\u2026well, you get the picture\nIn general, however, getting the right referrals even in small numbers, helps in building effective networks. Moreover, via your friends and colleagues who understand you and your culture, you are more likely to identify people who will be good for the company. [Hint: Facebook graph search works better than LinkedIn or any other tool for recruiting.]\nLinkedIn etc.\n: Social networks (especially, LinkedIn) are some of your best sources to look for passive talent. Especially when you have to \u2018hunt\u2019 for the right people; job portals work better for mass hiring, aka \u2018farming\u2019. The first question you need to answer before you fire up LinkedIn is what kind of candidate fits the bill? \u2013 What kind of profiles, firms, experience, education, and locations are you targeting? Now that you have what you need, start identifying similar profiles and then reach out to every single one. Send a message to connect, keep it cordial, direct, and give a quick overview of what your company does. When people get back to you, talk to them right away \u2013 memory based on LinkedIn messages is often short-lived.\nIn a nutshell: recruiting is always the biggest growth challenge for a fast growing company. We are now a 650-member organisation, and there has been no point in time when we felt hiring was easy. Sometimes we get so frustrated that we toy with the idea of just doing a massive outdoor campaign to announce the fact that we\u2019re hiring. Then sanity prevails. Although we\u2019ve chosen the path less traveled, we know from experience that we are investing time and money in the right people and the right hiring avenues.\nTell me what you think!"

        "content": "While making our first hires five years ago, we had one thing in mind \u2013 focus on identifying and hiring the right people. Of course, like all startups, getting the right people on board has been our biggest challenge. The growth of the business, the personality of the brand and the firm\u2019s culture all depend on the people who work with you and carry things forward. The team we have right now is our biggest achievement and scaling it up \u2013 an even bigger challenge. We\u2019ve always had two areas where finding great people hasn\u2019t particularly been a cakewalk \u2013 tech and leadership. So rather than sticking to traditional methods for hiring, we decided to experiment a little. We came up with two programs to scale this wall ahead of us \u2013 Trial Week (for tech) and the Leadership Program (obviously, to find leaders).\nOur\n\u00a0\nCall for Leaders\n\u00a0\nfocuses on getting in touch with people who have founded and led their own ventures in the past. It\u2019s simple \u2013 entrepreneurs develop a unique skillset, which makes them solution oriented, focused decision makers, and highly adaptable. We\u2019ve hired entrepreneurs in the past, and it\u2019s worked very well for us. They\u2019ve experienced ups and downs, and they understand what it takes to overcome challenges. The rarely complain about stuff, and are always in the state of fixing things which are broken.\nEach new market presents predictable tasks- hiring and managing a team, finding office space, sorting out regulatory paperwork, etc. But, if that was all that went into building our business, we wouldn\u2019t have to set the bar so high for our team. Each new market requires a leader with the mental flexibility to problem solve any and every challenge set before them, whether it is tailoring our product to different cultures or aggregating millions of data points around restaurants during monsoon season.\nOur other hiring challenge- getting the best and brightest in tech. Over time we realised that a 2-hour interview may not be the best way to test an engineer\u2019s technical skills (or the culture fit).There is only so much you can learn about someone during an interview and time is limited. It\u2019s not unusual for qualified candidates to panic, and ultimately we end up missing out as much as the candidate does.\nWe thought of a\n\u00a0\n\u201cTrial Week\u201d\n\u00a0\nto solve this issue. The program is mainly geared towards students, although graduates with a serious passion for engineering could also apply. Selected participants were invited to spend one week working with our tech team in Delhi on live projects. We made the program accessible to all by taking care of their travel, their stay in Delhi, and, of course, their food \ud83d\ude09\nThis trial works both ways- it\u2019s the best way for trialists to experience the work culture at Zomato firsthand and it allows us to see who can solve real problems in a fast-paced work environment. The trialists we see fit, in terms of skill and culture, are offered full-time positions at Zomato.\nEven with these new initiatives, hiring the right people still isn\u2019t easy. We will continue to innovate our hiring methods as we scale. There\u2019s a lesson in it for all of us \u2013 when you\u2019re up against a wall, you break through it."

        "content": "If there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve discovered \u2013 rediscovered, actually \u2013 about ourselves over the past year, it\u2019s that we\u2019re always looking for ways to out-do anything we\u2019ve done before. When we took our baby steps and launched international operations in Dubai in September last year, we thought we\u2019d done the biggest thing yet. At the turn of the year came London \u2013 and we thought we were doing something pretty big. In July, we launched five cities simultaneously to celebrate our fifth birthday. And we thought that was something. This time, it\u2019s three different kinds of big:\n1 \u2013 Today, we are launching our services in three new countries, Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia. And seven new cities in all. Brazil is undoubtedly everyone\u2019s dream destination for next year, and we have no intention of watching the game from the bench. We\u2019re in S\u00e3o Paulo for now, with 11 more cities (to complete all the 12 world cup venues) coming very soon. We have Jakarta covered in Indonesia, and in Turkey, we\u2019ve got Istanbul and Ankara on the map. That puts us in 35 cities across 11 countries now with plenty more to come.\n2 \u2013 Since we love nothing more than a challenge, we\u2019ve done something we\u2019ll be doing a lot more of as we go along \u2013 rolling out Zomato in more languages. In addition to the English version of the website and apps, you can now use Zomato in Portuguese, Bahasa Indonesia, and Turkish (in Brazil, Indonesia, and Turkey respectively). Looking back, this was a tough cookie to bite.\n\u00a0\n3 \u2013 And last, but not the least, we\u2019ve just raised another round of funding. USD 37 million \u2013 our biggest so far, and the biggest ever in the restaurant search space \u2013 from Sequoia Capital and Info Edge. It will allow us to push our geographical boundaries even further and enable us to take something you love to a lot of other people in various parts of the world. We intend to launch Zomato in 22 more countries over the next 2 years. Which 22 countries? Let\u2019s leave something for a surprise \ud83d\ude42 We thank Info Edge for all the ongoing support since the last few years. Zomato certainly has gained tremendously from the faith Sanjeev and team has shown in our team and product since the early days. We are also excited to partner with Sequoia to take this little food cart further. Sequoia\u2019s vision for Zomato completely aligns with ours and it is going to be exciting to work with them to build the future of dining. Incidentally, we opted for this investment over a lucrative, big-name strategic buyout. But that\u2019s a story for another day.\n==\nThe next few months will see Zomato prepare for scale. As we have done a few times, take a few steps back for a bigger leap. The product will change quite a bit, but we will make sure that you love us even more. Thank you for all your support so far. Please keep using Zomato, and please keep telling us where we suck. That, according to us, is the only way to build something phenomenal."

And the only measure of how much fun we\u2019ve been having, is how quickly the past year has gone by.\nA few days shy of a year ago today, we took a long,\n\u00a0\nhard look\n\u00a0\nat what it takes for a company (read: us) to go global. We\u2019d be lying if we said there was nothing to lose, and that we could venture into foreign markets with reckless abandon. After many a sleepless night of planning and debate, we took the plunge. Straight into the deep end of the pool. Our first stop? Dubai.\nBy September, we had our first international section ready to launch, with a total of 3,500 restaurants listed in Dubai. In the next couple of months, we added Abu Dhabi and Sharjah to the list of Emirates we were present in, taking our international presence to three cities. Our next international launch was slightly closer to home, with our Colombo (Sri Lanka) section going live soon after. By November, we were getting restless again. We\u2019d proven to ourselves that we could set seemingly insurmountable challenges, and then manage to complete them. We knew we needed to add more countries to the map and grow quicker. Since we are ardent believers in \u201cgo big or go home\u201d, we decided to go bigger than we\u2019d ever gone before. Our\n\u00a0\nLondon launch\n\u00a0\nwas one of the toughest yet, but it proved yet again that we had it what it takes to take on the big boys on the playground. By March, we\u2019d also set up operations in Doha, which had been in the pipeline for a while. Around the turn of the year, we\u2019d sent a few people out to explore a various potential markets for us. The Philippines and South Africa were two of the highlights of our scouting efforts, and we set our sights on launching in Metro Manila, and in multiple cities in South Africa. The third week of March saw our Metro Manila section going live with information for over 9000 restaurants in the city. Just about two weeks later, Zomato Johannesburg was live, with 2000 restaurants listed.\nWhile calling it\n\u00a0\n\u2018world domination\u2019\n\u00a0\nmakes us sound a little like evil super-villains, it\u2019s no secret that we\u2019d like to further grow our geographical footprint. In July this year, Zomato turned five. And since no birthday is complete without a little celebration, we decided we\u2019d launch five new cities to mark the occasion. We grew our presence in South Africa by launching a section for Cape Town, while also adding Birmingham and Manchester to the roster in the UK. Two of the five cities were also in a whole new country for us \u2013 Auckland and Wellington, in New Zealand.\nUndoubtedly, one of the most amazing aspects of growing so quickly has been the effort the team has put in. Right from collecting data in extreme weather conditions, burning the midnight oil to make sure all information gets listed, making product customisations to suit local preferences, to launching and driving marketing and PR in new locations. We\u2019re also very proud of how diverse our team is; our team is now made up of people from over different 15 nationalities doing a kickass job globally over the past year.\nIt\u2019s been an exhilarating ride so far, and we\u2019re sure the best is yet to come. As I write this, we are scrambling to get our operations set up in Brazil and Turkey. It isn\u2019t easy, but what\u2019s life without a challenge? After all, building a global company is just an itch that has to be scratched."

        "content": "Our engineering team is always cranking to improve our services and make your food hunt easier. As a small update, here is what\u2019s keeping us awake at night these days:\nBuilding a dish database\nWouldn\u2019t it be great if we could search for restaurants serving a specific dish? For example, it would be great to be able to find the best places that serve a Tenderloin Steak. The only way to make this happen is if we have structured data for every dish served in a restaurant. We\u2019ve already made some effort in this direction the manual way \u2013 by typing out a few thousand menu cards in every city that we are in. However, given the churn rate of the restaurant industry (about 25% restaurants shut down every quarter), it is getting difficult for us to manually keep pace with all the new menu cards that come our way. We are trying to create intelligent OCR systems to supplement our existing dish ontology. Misspellings (in the menus) and from the OCR mechanism just make it all the more complicated.\nSpam control\nTwo years ago, this wasn\u2019t a problem. Why? Very simply, a restaurant\u2019s rating Zomato didn\u2019t make or break its business back then. Nowadays, it does make a difference, to a certain extent. Since a lot of restaurant owners also realise this, they try to game the system by planting fake reviews on the platform. We have, over time, learnt how to identify most of these cases, but some intelligent spam tactics skip our automated filters. Our filters currently range from simple data analysis and pattern matching to user behaviour mapping over a few months. However, we realise that we constantly have to keep track of what is making its way onto the platform to help maintain its neutrality and usefulness to our users. Also, we need to evolve these systems to outsmart everyone who tries to game the system (despite following the rules). It\u2019s an ongoing effort, and I don\u2019t think we will ever be able to say this problem has been solved for good.\nLower server latency for our geographically widespread traffic\nThis isn\u2019t something new, and a few companies have already done this very efficiently. Most companies our size don\u2019t even care about this. However, we want to serve all our traffic (in the Philippines, as well as in London) from servers that sit close to our users\u2019 physical locations. Lower server latency = users get to food faster. Replicating all our infrastructure in various locations on a master-slave basis and then keeping everything in sync is not easy for us as of now, and this is something we are trying to address over the very short term itself. Do any of these challenges excite you? Do you think you can help us solve these issues? If yes, we are looking for you. Email me at d@zomato.com"

Zomato is a neutral platform where consumers write about their opinions and we respect that. Our job is to tell our users if they should go to a particular restaurant or not. Delisting restaurants defeats that purpose. For restaurants which are very poorly rated, we want our users to see their ratings/reviews and decide not to visit that place.\nA few other things some people have been saying about Zomato:\nZomato displayed wrong information about the Lemp event on the website\nZomato only displays what is sent to us via email by the restaurant owners or their PR firms. So essentially, all these offers are validated offers from the management itself. However, whether the restaurant eventually honours the offer is entirely up to the restaurant. In this case, what has been outlined in the blog against Lemp is that the manager even confirmed the offer on the phone, but refused to honour it on the premises. There is nothing anyone can do about such behaviour.\nZomato deletes negative reviews (and/or lets restaurant owners delete reviews)\nThis is the silliest thing we\u2019ve heard today. From our point of view, we run a neutral platform, and letting restaurant owners pick the reviews they want to display on that page would violate that neutrality. For us, customers come before ad dollars. Lemp was a paying advertiser for a long time, for about more than a year. But you can see a slew of negative reviews on their page which are as old as Lemp itself. Those reviews were never deleted and have been there forever for everyone to read. Anyway, in light of the incident and to honour the sentiments of our users, we took the ad down. As I said, customers before ad dollars.\nHaving said that, our moderation team does delete reviews (and no, restaurant owners cannot tell us what we should do). What our team does is that they manually weed out fake reviews (planted by restaurant owners, and their competitors) and also remove low value reviews. Sometimes, they also remove reviews with a personal vendetta against an establishment \u2013 such reviews are easily identifiable because the reviewer admittedly says that he/she hasn\u2019t been to the restaurant anyway.\nTo put some examples behind this, reviews such as this get deleted:\n\u201cFuck this place. I don\u2019t like it. This place sucks. I will never go here again.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been to this place, but I just read the review below. I think this place sucks.\u201d\n\u201cAwesome. Cool. I think this place has the coolest restaurant owner ever. The waiter, Bob, is one of the nicest people I have met.\u201d\nWe also delete reviews which are from the same IP address, and also use user behaviour pattern detection to flag fake reviews and ratings. However, in any spam control, there are a few false positives, but that is a cost we pay to keep the system clean.\n===\nNext steps for us: we are implementing a widget on our reviews page for a restaurant where you can filter reviews which are \u00bd/\u00be/5 star rated specifically. Currently, you have to scroll through a chronologically stack of reviews to find out why some place is not good or worth visiting. We hope that this helps our users make a wiser choice, the next time they visit Zomato to find a perfect place to eat/drink."

Problems exist across functions: Hiring, Sales, Content, International Expansion, Product Distribution. (For the trolls: we are doing very well as a company, these are anticipatory growth pangs).\n\u00a0\nSome roles which need to be filled right now:\nAVP Recruitment (2) \u2013 Needless to say, hire the best people across the globe, so that others can\u2019t find them\nVP Sales (2) \u2013 Based in Delhi, Mumbai; prior sales experience must\nAVP Content (3) \u2013 Manage and improve our massive content acquisition team spread across 7 countries (as of now)\nBusiness Heads \u2013 Some Indian Cities, Philippines, South Africa, Turkey, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil and Russia\nAVP Product Distribution: work with OEMs and partners to expand Zomato\u2019s digital reach across platforms; this role needs a tech background\nInterested?\n\u00a0\nWhat will the future look like for you?: Ideally, every 6-12 months, once you have solved the problem you were working on, you should move on to the next big challenge for us as a company. That could be in a different function altogether. You should be good enough to figure out the next big problems yourself and also be capable to work on them independently to solve them. In the longer term, given the pace at which we are growing, you should find yourself heading an international market at Zomato. In short, we are already 270 people strong, still small, and are planning to grow to around a 1000 people by the end of next year. So, we are looking to create a pipeline of senior management which will help us get there and also manage the mud pie once we get there. Want in, email me at deepinder@zomato.com PS: If you apply, think long term. Building a company is not a joke, it\u2019s a story. PS2: You should have a minimum of 4-5 years of experience; we want people with a little more perspective than usual."

        "content": "\u201cLife is a game of inches\u2026.the six inches in front of you\u201d \u2013 Al Pacino in Any Given Sunday\nThe evening of Nov 20th, 2012, sipping tea in our office, we were discussing the beauty of London during Christmas. Naturally, the conversation steered towards restaurants in London and how much fun it would be to spend Christmas in London while eating at some of the best restaurants in the world.\nSomewhere in the middle of the casual banter, someone jokingly said, \u201cThis Christmas, Zomato is coming to London\u201d. This was followed by complete silence\u2026and some goosebumps. The line was so powerful, that everybody wanted to bring Zomato to London, this very Christmas. Ohwhichbytheway was only 35 days away.\nWe have a habit of pressure testing Zomato and our people by putting big challenges, six inches in front them. So, we decided, that this Christmas, Zomato\n\u00a0\nis\n\u00a0\ncoming to London. This meant, we had to collect data for over 15,000 restaurants on foot in extreme cold, upload all the information, scan all the menus, and quality check everything before we could say London is live. On top of that, all the product and design changes that were needed to make sure that we were ready to compete in a market such as London, where we are going against some of the biggest, most respected players in the world.\nWe gave ourselves 35 days. Zomato needed to be in London.\n85 flights, about 1500 night outs, endless hours of brainstorming sessions, and after painfully missing the deadline by a good two weeks, Zomato is now in London. We have over 14,000 restaurants listed on Zomato London already and are still chugging along, uploading content for almost 500 restaurants everyday. Our team of six people is out everyday making sure we are covering every single alley in one of the biggest cities in the world. Just for reference, the number of restaurants in London is close to 50% of the entire Indian market.\nCurrently, the London section is by invitation only, but if you ask nicely, we will give you access. Please\n\u00a0\ngo here\n\u00a0\nto request access.\nOur investors, friends and family asked us very important questions about the London launch. Here are a few samples:\nWhy London, why not pick an easier market with fewer competitors?\nBecause we are not scared of a fight. More on this later.\nWhat will differentiate your product from others already out there?\nThe leather at the bottom of our shoes, rather \u2013 the lack of it. The same thing that works for us in India \u2013 we actually go around town and collect content on our own. We scan each and every menu card and put it up online for users to view for free. We geocode restaurants on our own and do not rely on erroneous public maps information to tell customers where they should go. If a restaurant exists, we want to see it for ourselves and then provide that information to people. Overall, we are a better product, with content that actually matters. Not everyone has the time to read 1000 reviews for a restaurant \u2013 but everyone wants to know what is served and how much will it cost.\nWill you be able to get better penetration and coverage than your competitors who have been there for ages?\nAs of now, we have 14,000 restaurants listed on Zomato London. With about 3,000 more to go, our coverage is almost double of the next biggest player. We have always believed that a better product wins and are putting our money where our mouth is.\nDoes this make business sense?\nWe don\u2019t know. But here is our theory, Risk Execution = Rewards. We are willing to play this game and bet on ourselves.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nStay calm and execute in London. Just like we did in UAE- where we are one of the top few websites in the country in less than 6 months.\nWe know London won\u2019t be that easy, so we need your help. If you love Zomato, please help us reach out to as many people in London as possible. We need you to make this work."

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/improving-the-ratings-system-on-zomato/",
        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "It\u2019s been more than four years since Zomato started. Over these years, we have served about 55 million visitors on Zomato through our website and mobile apps. Zomato ratings have over time become the de facto look up system for our customers to decide whether they should \u00a0visit a particular restaurant or not.\nGiven the traffic on Zomato, a lot of restaurant owners, or their agents (PR companies), or competitors try to game the system by giving out unfair positive or negative ratings for restaurants on Zomato. This leads to a huge amount of what we call \u201crating spam\u201d in the system. This eventually leads to a poor customer experience on the website, eventually making Zomato lose credibility in the eyes of the customer.\nHowever, with all the experience we have with us, we have made some significant improvements to our system to weed out spam and unworthy votes from the system. Broadly, we have classified user behaviour on the website on the scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is \u2018dubious\u2019 and 10 is \u2018trustworthy\u2019. So, overall, from today onwards, any ratings from \u2018dubious\u2019 users do not count towards the ratings aggregates shown on Zomato; whereas we are allocating more weight to users who we deem to be \u2018trustworthy\u2019.\nThere are still some things we need to improve and think about. For example, the votes count next to the ratings shows the total votes received for the restaurant. Not necessarily the votes being considered towards the aggregate. We are not sure yet if we should be that transparent. In our opinion, more transparency leads to more spam, which is something nobody wants (e.g. Google never reveals its search ranking algorithms).\nAlso, there is a lot of science going behind classifying users between \u2018dubious\u2019 and \u2018trustworthy\u2019. This is a mix of manual and algorithmic grading. Our users who we have met in real life (we meet a lot of our users over lunches :-)), are automatically given 10 on the trust scale.\nI am hoping this will go a long way towards improving the authenticity of ratings being shown on Zomato, and help our valued users discover more great places to eat around them."

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "A lot of startups ask me for advice on PR. That seems like one of the biggest buckets of marketing for any new company. My general point of view here is to tell people to create a great product and that PR will take care of itself. However, it is really necessary to avoid some pitfalls which result in startups wasting their time and money \u2013 two of the most important resources for a budding company. In general, I think startups should not outsource most of the things that they need to do. Whenever you outsource something, the other person will not love and care for your product the way you do \u2013 especially if you are not paying well, something which startups rarely can do. So at the end of the day, even if you don\u2019t have the skills (or the network) to do something, doing that thing with passion will result in a better outcome than outsourcing it to someone with skills who does it half-heartedly. Now let\u2019s get to PR. My basic premise here is that journalists are good people \u2013 they are always looking out for something meaningful and interesting to write about. So as long as you have something important to say, people will listen. Getting someone else (PR firms) to say what you want to say is half the battle lost. Nobody can broadcast your passion for your product. You have to speak out for yourself. We have tried working with a few PR firms along the way. Only one of them added value to Zomato. Why? Because that PR firm was a startup and doing a good job for us was really important for them. So they put everything they had into working with us. But, it is very hard to find such PR firms. Almost impossible. We also trusted some of the most well known PR firms with our brand communications only to receive less-than-mediocre results in the end and in some cases no results at all. Most of the these PR firms have a number of clients (sometimes 10 clients per person in their firm). They just cannot do a good job because they are spread too thin. It\u2019s probably the economics of the business which do not allow them to do a good job. But startups cannot afford a bad job for the sake of economics. There is something they have to do to get the message out there. There is a word for that \u2013 DIY. Let\u2019s go through some of the jargon you will get from a PR firm when you ask for a proposal. Below is the summary of ~20 such proposals we received over the last 3 months:\nSeamless promotion and reputation management of your brand\nBuild thought leadership in the domain\nOffer strategic internal and external communications consultancy\nSpearhead our brand journalism strategy to stay on top of mind\nCreate opportunities with blogger community in the region\nBuild KOLs \u00a0(Key Opinion Leaders) for the Brand\n\u2026and this list goes on! Most of this means nothing, and at the end of the day, what gets delivered is one press release per month. That too, is sent over emails in the public domain to journalists, with a lot of them marked in the BCC. All for some ridiculous pricing. PR firms typically charge for creating a press release (25-40k per release), media management (40-60k per month) and media monitoring (5-15k per month). Dear startups, please write your press releases yourself. Look up a format on the free world wide web and start chugging on a notepad. Let your passion come out in the press release. And there is no such thing as media management (it\u2019s just a few emails sent to a few people, followed by a phone call if someone writes back) \u2013 something startups should do on their own. And don\u2019t even get me started on media monitoring. It\u2019s as simple as setting Google Alerts for your brand \u2013 that is what all PR firms do anyway and then send you a jazzy alert on their own. Brand communication is something that is important to a budding startup. It has to be nurtured over time, and the first step towards doing it the right way is to roll up your sleeves, get your hands dirty and to do it yourself. By doing so, you will be cutting down on a lot of unnecessary recurring spend on PR firms which deliver appallingly minimal results. You will also develop a strong culture of owning what you communicate about the brand as it is meant to be. For a start, the founders should take care of this themselves. In the longer term, get someone to do this. It\u2019s not easy, but here are a few traits to look out for in that person:\nBelief in the product:\n\u00a0\nYou need a person who lives, breathes and feels the product to talk about it. A yardstick that we often use when we focus on building our PR team is to see if the person talks about the product and handles any query as if he/she owned and built it. Couple that with creativity in building PR opportunities, excellent writing and communication skills and you have The One for this role! This is something you will never get out of a PR agency. No matter how long you have them on board for, they will always refer to it as \u201ctheir product\u201d instead of \u201cour product\u201d.\nPersistent and gets things done:\n\u00a0\nIt is a challenging role like no other so you would need a person who would go to the last mile to deliver results. The probability of rejection is much higher in PR than in the Marriage business. You would need someone who can handle rejection on a daily basis. One who strongly believes that hearing back an answer (either yes or no) means that we have taken the first step in establishing a relationship with the concerned person or publication. Following-up is equivalent to breathing when it comes to PR and only if you are persistent can you handle it perfectly.\nShould wear your brand\u2019s t-shirt proudly:\n\u00a0\nHe/She should be the person you would proudly ask to wear your brand\u2019s t-shirt and go to a jam packed conference. This person is your key to the outside world; just make sure your choice is right. His/Her personality is seen as your brand\u2019s personality.\nPR is not about just building a media database and sending press releases, it\u2019s about talking to people (journalists) and having something meaningful to say. Also, do not mass email a press release. You hate spam, and everyone else does too. Personalise what you have to say, and make it relevant to the person you are writing to. Communicate with journalists like you do with your friends. Keep your emails focused on what you have to say and what might be relevant to them. If you are doing something that interests them, they will definitely respond. Follow up if you have to (and meet them if they are up for it), but respect other people\u2019s privacy. Do not bombard them with phone calls everyday. I agree that you will need a list of relevant people to talk to at the start. Again, Google is your best friend here. Look for topics in your domains and find people who cover those topics. Also, you would find a lot of media databases publicly and for free. One other thing you can do is to make a list of bloggers who might be relevant to your product. There are several blog aggregator sites with blog rankings to prioritise your efforts here (Labnol \u2013 IndianBloggers, Indiblogger, BlogAdda etc). While there is no guarantee that by doing all of the above your brand will be talked about every day but we have observed that over time it yields better results than any other way of going about it. The biggest take-away would be to keep calm and execute. What do you think? Do you think we could have done something differently?"

        "content": "Earlier this week, we took a baby step towards becoming an international company by rolling out the Dubai section on Zomato.com. Incidentally, right before we made our Dubai section live, I read\n\u00a0\nthis\n\u00a0\narticle on Pluggd.in by Prashant Singh, which I had loved. The article nailed some of the crucial reasons why start-ups in India can (or cannot) go global, and what to expect when the naysayers throw the kitchen sink at you.\nWe experienced some of the same jitters a year ago, when international expansion started looking like an inevitable part of our future. Here are some thoughts on the story so far and some lessons we hope to carry forward on this journey.\nIt\u2019s about the product:\n\u00a0\nOne cardinal truth that trumps absolutely everything, including a business idea, is that you need to have a world-class product. If you are building \u201cfor the Indian Market\u201d, you kind of have it backwards. The distinction should not exist in the first place when it comes to the quality of the product. You can have features that cater to the Indian market (see Delivery, Cash-on), but the look and feel of the product, and the features that it offers should be nothing short of what the most discerning user will want. If, at any point of time, you have said \u2013\n\u00a0\nchalta hai\n\u00a0\n\u2013 because it\u2019s only for the Indian user, you are not ready. We weren\u2019t ready either, until we were.\nUnderstand your roots:\n\u00a0\nWhile it may sound borderline cheesy, it\u2019s very important to understand where you come from. Our success in the Indian market is a product of our content platform. Building an operation that updates 40,000 menus in 12 cities every three months is no joke. Replicating it in another country with a new team is a whole different story. When we sat down with a map and started evaluating markets where we wish to go, the probability of replicating our operations model was paramount. There are markets out there that are ripe for a product like ours, but probably have socio-economic factors like cost of labour that will make our model unsustainable. We are choosing to stick to what we are geared for, and what we understand. Personally, I do not like the idea of trying to operate in a new language while also re-inventing our operations. If you don\u2019t know your limitations, you are not ready.\nWho comes first, the user or the merchant?\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s always the user, except when you are trying to evaluate the market. We can go to a market with the highest rates of internet penetration \u2013 but unless the merchants (in our case the restaurant industry) are playing ball, we will be making sandcastles by ourselves very soon. This is an issue that transcends industries. While we want to be involved in a huge market place, the ease of doing business with local merchants dominates the eventual decision. In order to source revenue from a local market, you have to understand the business-to-business environment. For instance, we look at signs in the local market of restaurants advertising in print, hoardings or even radio advertisement. If they are willing to engage with any platform (including online) we can work with them and show them the value proposition in our model. If you cannot clearly identify who is going to butter your bread, you are not ready.\nHit the streets:\n\u00a0\nThere is \u2013 and I cannot stress this enough \u2013 no alternative to doing your market research first-hand. Maybe once you are big enough and can hire a Bain and Company team to size up the market opportunity for you in three neat slides, can you afford to enter a new market while chilling in India. Until then \u2013 there is no option but to sweat it out at the highest level. The biggest asset in a start-up is usually the entrepreneur who has learned the ins and outs of the business the hard way. There is no amount of market research and savvy internet searches that can replace the inherent intuition of the \u201cwrinkled, war-hardened\u201d entrepreneur (see\n\u00a0\n@pankajchaddah\n). If you aren\u2019t willing to melt in the Dubai summer [see below ;-)] to launch two weeks after Ramadan, despite being the founder of a successful Indian startup, you are not ready.\nKnow your government and theirs:\n\u00a0\nOne of the biggest advantages that Indian start-ups have is the ability to work in uncertain and haphazard business environments. Leveraging that advantage is important, but walk through that immigration line with a comprehensive understanding of the challenges. One of the surprising revelations going through international expansion is the realisation that doing business in India can be a cakewalk as compared to the business environment in some other places. Abroad, incorporation paperwork can be onerous, labor laws stifling, and the access to basic business services can be severely limited. This doesn\u2019t mean working abroad through an India-based company is piece of cake either. Any start-up that has tried to get authorisation for the automatic route of capital transfer can relate to the bewildering lack of clarity around these regulations. \u00a0So, if you think doing business in India is tough, you are not ready.\nSave a few bullets:\n\u00a0\nWe have now spent a considerable amount of time (over a year and counting) building features that don\u2019t necessarily add value to our Indian business, but are thought to be evolutionary steps in the growth of Zomato on a global level. We might not be able to turn them on in every market we enter, but it\u2019s comforting to know we brought a gun to a knife fight. So, unless you are at a stage in your evolution where you can afford to build a few features \u2013 just so you can be ready for a variety of new challenges \u2013 you are not ready.\nAlbinder Dhindsa is the Head of International Expansion at Zomato.

Earlier this week, when we realized that it has been four years since Deepinder and I started Zomato, our initial reaction was one of confusion. We had to cross check with other significant life events to make sure we were right \u2013 and we were. After digesting this information, we decided to do something special and grand to celebrate this milestone, i.e. we decided to create an infographic. What you see below is the fruit of four years of hard work of many people, and to each and every person, who has had a role to play in this journey; I want to say \u2013 Thank you!\n\u00a0The last four years have been nothing short of dramatic for the Zomato team. We started out of a living room and it took us almost two years to actually move into something that resembled an office (barely). We changed our name from Foodiebay to Zomato during this time, and learned constructive things like Deepinder should not be photographed next to small objects (he makes them look smaller or in most cases, eats them). We learned that girls will discuss their healthy eating habits while eating Oreos with iced tea. We tried to find answers to some of mankind\u2019s burning questions, like which cake sticks the best\u00a0\n(link to Sabse Chipku Cake)\n. Along the way, we were able to convince some people that behind the madness, we housed a kickass team that lived and breathed Zomato.\u00a0\nThey\n\u00a0invested in us, and allowed us the freedom to grow from a few cities to ten and, even look beyond India. They allowed us to dream up visions of a Zomato that was there for our customers at all times (hello\u00a0\nZomato on Mobile\n). We even tried to go to places (err\u2026 Ahmedabad!) where only the brave souls venture, just so that no stone\u00a0\n(dhokla?)\n\u00a0remained unturned in our quest to help people discover more places to eat around them. In fact, this desire to be the GPS for food,\u00a0\ndrove\n\u00a0us (pun intended) to make product improvements that helped with every aspect of eating out. We launched Zomato\u2019s social platform to bring together the foodie community and improved the UI of the website to get users to the relevant information accurately and efficiently. Along the way we also helped a number of restaurants thrive as the process of word of mouth, got turbo charged from the Zomato community. Some of these places even ended up becoming our advertising clients and gave us the belief that our dreams of a sustainable business model around our passion for food were not delusional. The single biggest contributing factor to everything we have been able to do so far, has been our terrific user community who have not only been our brand ambassadors but also our biggest marketing engine. They have believed in the product and prodded us along with suggestions, criticisms and hot tips. Our users,\u00a0\nYOU\n, are the reason we have grown from Zero to Zomato in four years. Cheers to a wonderful 4 years, and many more to come.\u00a0\nPankaj Chaddah is the co-founder and COO of Zomato. Follow his rants on twitter at\u00a0\n@pankajchaddah"

        "content": "Zomato\u2019s almost 4 years old now. And our primary revenue model is advertising. Advertising from restaurants \u2013 yes, the very ones which you see, rate and review on Zomato. Being a local search platform, we very much have the technological ability to modify the ratings or reviews of a restaurant and drive footfall to that business. But we have never done that and are very clear that we will never compromise on our content for revenue.\u00a0This is indeed a difficult line to draw \u2013 here are some tidbits of the challenges we face while maintaining our stand.\nFirst, let me give you a couple of specific examples:\n1) When we launched our print guide, there had to be only a couple of hundred restaurants included in the guide. The concept of a print guide that we were putting on the table did not give us the liberty to be comprehensive. We had to be selective. In Delhi NCR region alone, we have about 300 restaurant businesses advertising with us. A large chunk of these was not a part of our print guide. While we could have included all/most of our existing clients and made an effort to up-sell print advertising to them, we chose not to do this and instead create a product which our customers would enjoy.\n2) A newly opened restaurant got a bad review on its page, and due to the credibility (# of reviews up-votes on reviews) of the reviewer, this bad review always showed up as the first review on its page. This restaurant owner called us up and proposed a significant sum of money as advertising fee if we took the review down. Needless to say, we did not do that. We face such (or similar) problems more than twice every week.\nNow let\u2019s get to the end result of both these things. The success of our restaurant guide, driven by the mood based themes, something unique in the market \u2013 proved our hypothesis.\u00a0Customers love the selection in the guide and have sent us emails on how different and better we are than the other print food guides in the market. This is a much bigger win than revenue. Here, advertising revenue is getting more than balanced by the actual sales figures. Which is what we value much more than anything else.\nWe have had umpteen restaurants over time offering money to take a review down. I can vouch that most of these restaurant owners who have tried to offer us money for reviews have seen their business shut down in the next 3-6 months. Lesson: ruining Zomato\u2019s reputation for short term money makes zero long term sense.\nThere is a positive side to the whole picture. A lot of young entrepreneurs are opening up restaurants. They run businesses which take negative feedback in their stride, improve their food/service and if required, reinvent themselves to survive. We love working with such restaurant owners \u2013 these are people who believe in creating good products. So far, maintaining our stance of editorial integrity has paid off very well \u2013 both tangibly and intangibly. And luckily for us, there is a sizable number of restaurant owners we would love to work with.\nStill, we face a problem of spam ratings and reviews by restaurant owners on their restaurants and competing restaurants. And we work our asses off to keep that under control. But that is a story for another day."

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "Ok, this post should have been up a few days ago. Anyways, the big news is that Zomato is now social. What does that mean? We have always believed that Zomato needs to be a social product. The timing to make it social was a question we had been grappling with for a long time. We definitely didn\u2019t want an unused social feature on the website, so we were waiting for reasonable scale on the website before we brought out these features. Hitting 2.5 million visitors per month (considering that only 1% users engage in any premium feature of a service like ours) sounded like we could introduce these features now. Now, let\u2019s be very clear, we consider Zomato to be a \u201csocial product\u201d \u2013 not a social network, but a social product. It is something that an entire community of foodies contributes to as well as partakes of. Even before Zomato had user reviews, our roots were deeply social. We grew via word of mouth, through utilizing our friends lists on everything from Orkut [we had a Zomato community on Orkut :)] to Facebook. This was partly a result of extreme lack of currency in our bank account (which in turn was related to a steadfast refusal to sacrifice good food), but mostly, it was driven by the fact that the generation that was adopting our product was used to being very socially engaged. Especially, the foodie nation. Food and good food experiences are what we feel compelled to share with others. Think about the number of times you have told your friends about a great place that you discovered. This is the domain where Zomato has always existed. With user reviews, we provided foodies with a way to broadcast their feelings about restaurants and food to a wider community \u2013 and these were the same foodies that were also listening to what the others were saying. Over time, we came to appreciate the power of this user-generated content. So much so, it formed the basis of choosing places to feature in our print guide. The power of our community helped us re-imagine information gathering for a traditional medium like print. As we looked ahead to the possibilities of this social aspect of Zomato, we wanted to provide tools to our foodies that would bind this community better. We wanted everyone to be able to relate over food and tastes, and use our collective knowledge even more effectively. With this vision in mind, we are unveiling Zomato\u2019s social tools. Now, foodies have the power to do more than just read and write reviews. They can follow the recommendations and reviews of kindred spirits \u2013 which can be shared among other foodies and their followers. The integration isn\u2019t an attempt to turn Zomato into a social network where you like someone\u2019s kitten video; rather it is a way to bring our community together over their shared love of food. I hope you enjoy connecting with other foodies and their experiences in this new iteration of Zomato.\nAnd yes, welcome to an all new, social Zomato."

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "\u201cMediocrity is a disease. Excellence is a habit.\u201d \u2013 God knows who. If you have a startup that is doubling in size every quarter, hiring must be the most important part of your job. The pressure to hire right makes the job all the more stressful. Nobody likes making mistakes (especially recruiting mistakes). Looking back, some of the key reasons why we have made recruiting mistakes are: 1) Desperation to add people to a very overworked team 2) Not being able to pinpoint what is wrong with the candidate while your gut says \u2018no\u2019 3) Not knowing what kind of people to hire for a specific role The last one is part of the learning process for a startup. There is pretty much nothing you can do to avoid it. Especially if you are trying to reinvent the way things work. The first two are the side-effects of a hire-fast policy. Over time, we have learnt that hiring fast can be handled in a much smarter way. In a young and growing startup, you have to make sure that you don\u2019t lower the bar for incoming people, because you will never be able to raise it again. To compensate for the deceleration which comes with maintaining a high bar, put more people into scaling up your hiring so that you meet more people before finding the perfect fit. Only hire when you are not able to find an excuse to not hire that person. However, no matter how many interview rounds you conduct, or who interviews potential candidates, or how low your acceptance rate is, the fact of the matter is that you will always end up making a few recruiting mistakes. Why? Because it is very difficult to judge people over interviews. You have to work with them for a few days to get to know what they are worth. They will only be their real self once they start working with you on a regular basis. The key is to not get bogged down by these mistakes, but take them in your stride and fix them as soon as possible. And it\u2019s vital to move as fast as possible. Procrastinating on firings always lead to the question \u2013 \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we do this a long time ago?\u201d. Sometimes, though, firing decisions are not simple. To make the decision making process simpler and cleaner for ourselves, we have developed a way of thinking which has almost always served us well. All people while being evaluated (on whether they should be asked to leave), go through a step-by-step filter, where each step has a different set of consequences. Here\u2019s the rule set that we follow:\nLevel 1: Ethics\nThere has to be a zero compromise on ethics. If a Sales person tells us that he had a meeting with a client while he was chilling at home, it is not acceptable. If an employee makes a mistake and tells us that it wasn\u2019t him, it is not acceptable. Honesty and hard work are the basics which bond a startup team together \u2013 there is no space for such demeanour. The worst part is that if you warn people at such things, they almost always never learn. They would do the same thing after a few months. The only thing that makes people learn and imbibe these things are repercussions. Repercussions teach them that the potential long-term downside of failing at ethics is always bigger than the short-term upside. Failing at ethics leads to instant firings. No questions asked.\nLevel 2: Respect\nEvery last person in your organization deserves the same amount of respect as the first. If an employee disrespects someone, even for a valid reason, he/she contributes to a negative vibe in the office which makes it difficult for work to happen. It is vital to maintain a positive and pleasant working environment in a startup. This is where it gets subjective. But your instinct will tell you whether what you are about to do is right or wrong. e.g. if a male employee calls his female colleague a b**ch (and other things) in front of 10 other people for some stupid reason, you know what to do.\nLevel 3: Attitude\nEverybody needs to sport a \u201ccan-do\u201d attitude and believe that nothing is below his/her dignity. The proverbial \u201cbringing coffee for the team\u201d is not what I am talking about here. I am talking about even simpler things like taking packaging paper and wrapping 1000 copies of a book with gift paper overnight. If someone says that this is not his/her job description, it\u2019s a problem. Every last thing in a startup is everybody\u2019s job description. In such cases, someone needs to sit with the person and explain to him/her that they need to pull up their socks. Still, if this person acts pricey one more time (make sure you put him on a test soon enough), you have a problem which you need to fix.\nLevel 4: Skills\nThis is where people are not able to do their job well. This is ok, as long as they are trying. As long as they are asking for help. This is where people are given enough time to learn and do a better job \u2013 of course, only if they are doing well on Levels 1, 2 & 3. They are not asked to leave as long as they are putting in their best effort. If possible, try to find some other role for them where they can possibly contribute more. Over time, however, if things don\u2019t start working out, it becomes counterproductive for the person to stay at the company. It is then mutually decided that the person needs to find somewhere else where he/she would fit and perform better.\n=======\nLooking back, all the people that we have asked to leave have either failed at Level 1 (Ethics) or Level 3 (Attitude). Mostly at Level 3. Overall, quickly asking these people to leave has resulted in a very healthy organization where all the good people know that they are valued as long as they are contributing to the growth of the company. Everybody understands that it is completely meritocratic here and that age and experience do not count for anything. But what about all those people who left us? My perspective here is that parting ways is good for the employee as well as the organization. It relieves the organization of dead weight and gives these employees an opportunity to spend enough time to look for an alternative organization with a culture and a role they would do very well at. Thoughts?"

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "The key to creating a powerful brand is having very vocal brand ambassadors for your company. Looking at it from a traditional marketer\u2019s point of view, this is one of the toughest things to achieve. Well, that is what formal education does to you. We, at Zomato, have a good number of loyal customers who talk about us whenever there is a conversation around food and restaurants. To create such a brand, we have made our fair share of mistakes, but have learned quite a bit about the best practices to get it done. And none of us here have any marketing background, we are all engineers who tell it like it is. There are four ways in which you can create powerful associations with your customers:\nPut customers first\nA lot of times, under various pressures, we make changes to our product/service which are not received well by our customers. For all these changes, always measure the short term gain vs. the long term loss that you will incur. Most of the times, the potential loss will be bigger than gain. In all such cases, put the customer in the middle of your decision making process and then take a call. Here at Zomato, there is a constant tug of war going on between the sales team and the product team. The sales team wants to plaster advertisements all over the website. The product team doesn\u2019t, and it always wins.\nGet personal with feedback\nFeedback is give by those who care. So please don\u2019t insult them with automated email replies. So, when a customer writes in to your company for feedback, have a real person write back, saying that you value their feedback and also tell the customer whether or not you are going to address what they suggested. All this while, do remember that the customer is always right. And end the email with a thank you like you mean it (you should!). Lazy marketers always come up with an excuse that they cannot handle all the volume of feedback/queries that they get. The truth is that they just don\u2019t care.\nTreat customer service as your core strength\nGreat customer service builds the strongest brand ambassadors. Make sure that you put your best foot forward while creating the customer service department. We, at Zomato, did this top down. For the first month, all our business heads were taking care of all emails/queries directly. Understanding the effort and business intelligence that goes behind customer service, they now have their best people manning the department. And they still get copied on each and every email that goes out to any customers. We all really love our customers, and can clearly see that they love us back.\nBe emotional\nYour customers will only care for your product if you do. Show people that you love your product from the way you create your product as well as market it. For example, in your product\u2019s tagline, simply saying what your product does will not muster any support for you. You have to tell people why you created what you created. If that resonates with someone, you have created a loyal user before that person even uses your product. This is something we believe in very strongly. To this effect, we changed our product tagline from \u201cIndia\u2019s #1 online restaurant guide\u201d to \u201cDiscover more places to eat around you\u201d. No one must have visited our website by learning that we are India\u2019s biggest online restaurant guide. But a lot of users must have used our product to discover more places to eat around them. Which is why we built it in the first place. What do you think? Anything we can add here?"

We really only had 4 days to execute the commercial and get the tapes over to the TV channels. True to Calvin, we managed to create a decent product. We\u2019ve never really believed in agencies to do this work \u2013 we have already wasted our time and money with one of the most popular web viral creation agencies in India to get zero results. We agree that these agencies have some of the best creative minds of our generation, but they are swamped with so much work that they can\u2019t really do justice to a startup like us.\nAll of us here at Zomato, are living in a box. Not literally, but it is hard to get new ideas after creating and working on a product for over three years. In the recent past, we ran a campaign where we asked our users to blog us their feedback about Zomato.com \u2013 it was a smash hit for us and we got invaluable feedback and ideas from our users. \u00a0A lot of it, we incorporated in our current iteration of the product.\nOn a much bigger scale, we now want our users to create innovative TV ads for us. The prize is good and I am hoping it will excite a lot of lesser known agencies and animators to put together their best and come up with something which can never come out of a professional agency. Don\u2019t know if any other startup/company has tried anything like this before in India, but an experiment either works or fails. We are so hoping that it works!\nThe rules of the game are available at:\n\u00a0\nwww.zomato.com/tvc\nNew Year Commercial Links\nhttp://youtu.be/JZK_Ej4MzYc\nhttp://youtu.be/QQs4JuG-sxg"

        "content": "We\u2019ve had a great 2012 so far! Starting with cleaning up after the massive New Year\u2019s ticketing initiative that we pulled off (which went very very well for us as an organization), we have further strengthened our restaurant content base and and now have in-depth info for close to 30,000 restaurants on Zomato. Number of users are at an all time high for both our web and mobile platforms. Our Events section has seen tremendous growth and we have also been lucky to partner with some major events across cities (Comedy Store, Lucky Ali concerts, M.A.D Festival in Ooty, Annual Comedy Festival, Essel World and many more). We are excited with all the activity happening at Zomato and we wanted to take some time to update you on what we\u2019ve been working on over the last few months.\nWe have three major updates for you:\nLaunch of our print guide: Yes you read it right \u201cprint\u201d! We\u2019ve just moved into print with the launch of \u2018Citibank Zomato Restaurant Guide 2012\u2019 for 4 cities in India \u2013 Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore and Pune; more cities next year!\nWeb: we made things better for you on the web \u2013 it should be now easier for you to narrow down to the restaurant to go to or an event to attend.\nMobile: Windows Phone native app launched and this is the first time we\u2019ve introduced Events on a mobile platform.\nLets dive into each one in more detail:\n1) Print guide: Citibank Zomato Restaurant Guide 2012\nWe are expanding to the print medium by launching the \u201cCitibank Zomato Restaurant Guide 2012\u201d for 4 cities \u2013 Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore and Pune. Being published by the world-renowned Hachette Book Group, Citibank Zomato Restaurant Guide 2012 is already available for pre booking on Flipkart (short url:\n\u00a0\nzoma.to/guides\n). Ok. So why print? Over time, we want to be the brand which people look up when they need to decide where to eat. And we want to be platform agnostic. We know that there will always be a segment which will appreciate the paperback guide to good food around them. But, almost all Food Guides in the market today are directories/ yellow-pages for restaurants, which provide basic info but do not aid users much in taking a decision quickly (it really takes ages for people to decide where to eat after looking at these\u00a0encyclopedic\u00a0guides).\u00a0After all, the search for an appropriate place is based not only on cuisine, price and location but also the \u2018occasion\u2019 or \u2018mood\u2019. Our Restaurant Guide is an endeavor to solve this problem. So what we created are unique \u2018occasion\u2019 based guides that recommend restaurants based on different needs (or use cases) that we have observed our users looking out for. Ranging from Romantic Dinner, Beer in a Bar, Girls\u2019 Night Out to Dining with Kids, the guide shall take you through the best recommendations for all key occasions. So, if you have you ever asked your friends \u201cwhere can I take my girlfriend for a nice romantic dinner?\u201d or \u201cwhat\u2019s a great place to grab a couple of beers after work?\u201d, our restaurant guides will answer the questions for you. It is not an encyclopedia of restaurants but a carefully designed list of recommendations for a particular \u2018occasion\u2019.\u00a0The guide is already available for pre-order on Flipkart and will be launched in the second week of May 2012.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2) Web: A whole new Zomato experience\nWe\u2019ve just released a new version of Zomato on the web with a plethora of changes. The primary focus of the updates has been to provide the best user experience possible for anyone looking to discover or search for restaurants or events. We believe the latest version of Zomato does exactly that and are looking forward to our users explore what we have to offer in a totally new way.\nRestaurants section\nA new lean and mean user interface: The look and feel of the new design is minimalistic and the focus is on presenting the content in a much better format. Users should be able to search, use filters and browse restaurant info much more quickly than before.\nTop 25 restaurants in the city: For a foodie, one question is always on the mind \u201cWhich are the best places to eat in this city right now?\u201d Highlighted on the homepage, this section provides the top 25 trending restaurants based on user data on a weekly basis to cater to that craving.\nImproved Search functionality: I admit that our search is not great, hence striving towards an improved one. The new Zomato search is a little more intelligent and identifies if you are looking for a cuisine in a locality and also has an intrinsic spell check.\nFoodie credibility and a better user profile: Our users take a lot of time and effort to share their experiences with the foodie community on Zomato through user reviews and we constantly take actions to build this into a strong community. With Foodie credibility, we want to reward (virtually) people who are the most active and respected members of the Zomato community. We have also given a \u201cSort by reviewer credibility\u201d filter to everyone to quickly get to read reviews from the most seasoned foodies. Currently, based on the number of reviews submitted we are classifying users into the following 4 categories (the numbers might increase in the future):\nFoodie: upto 10 reviews\nBig Foodie: upto 20 reviews\nSuper Foodie: upto 35 reviews\nConnoisseur: more than 35 reviews\nA new way to explore events: We\u2019ve completely revamped the user interface making it easier for the user to know all about the events happening in the city.\nFeatured events: The featured section now has a new bookshelf layout. Using the left and right keys one can quickly get to know about the best events taking place in the city.\nImproved search and display: We\u2019ve improved our search and one can search for events using event name, artist or venue. The search results layout is now in a grid format and users can explore Events using filters location on top (by location and category of events) and left (by date) of the matrix.\nA better Event details layout: The Events page is now easier to navigate with all details such as venue, contact details, photos and description on the left and tickets available on the right. A user can also look at past and upcoming events at the venue. This is followed by the venue location on a map, similar events nearby and nearby restaurant sections.\nThis is a big change \u2013 we are getting a lot of feedback (good and bad!) and we might be changing a few things in the future.\n3) Mobile: Windows Phone native app\nWe recently launched the native app for the Windows mobile platform (Windows Phone OS). Windows Phone is a very promising product and is growing at a very fast pace. What differentiates the Windows app from apps on other platforms are its amazingly fast Metro UI and the Events guide which Zomato has launched on mobile for the first time. The application allows users to search and explore for nearby restaurants based on the user\u2019s location and events happening in the city. In terms of downloads, we already have 10,000 downloads of our WP app since the launch. We believe that we have leveraged the amazingly fast and smooth UI offered by WP well and are looking forward to reach out to more and more WP users. Zomato on WP Features:\nDiscover: Shake your device and discover a nearby recommendation.\nExplore: Gives you a list of restaurant recommendations based on your current location. You can also enter a location and get the list of recommendations.\nSearch: You can search for restaurants by the name, cuisine or location.\nReviews: Read and write reviews for restaurants.\nMaps & Photos: Locate restaurants on the map and view actual pictures of the restaurant before getting there.\nEvents: Gives you all details for Events happening in the city during the week"

        "content": "Back in 2005, fresh out of IIT, I started working on a foodie startup with some good friends. Our families and friends were the security blanket for us. And we worked tirelessly to make the startup work. It didn\u2019t. I realized that we weren\u2019t quite sure what we wanted to be as a firm, nor did we surround ourselves with the talent that could help us figure out a path to this uncertain destination.\nIn 2008, when Pankaj and I gave the idea another shot, we focused on creating a product that we would want. Luckily, a few hundred thousand other people wanted it too. It worked. In some time, we started doing well with a 4 member team that included 2 interns. A year later, Pankaj and I quit our jobs to do this full time and we haven\u2019t regretted a minute of it. We love what we do and that\u2019s the reason why we can do it for 14 hours a day, 365 days a year. Along the way, we have been joined by over a 100 people who are as passionate about Zomato as we are.\nAll of us here at Zomato, believe that the only way to grow this organization is by adding people who are better than us. We look for people who have the passion of Don Quixote with the mental strength to serve in the Indian Army. We look for people who can drive change. People who have a point to prove \u2013 to themselves rather than others. People who have never been part of the rat race. Or the ones who want to pull out of the race. Because that race is not anyways the one they want to win.\nTimeout. You are probably wondering why we need such people to run a \u2018review website\u2019. This needs explanation. Zomato was never started as a \u2018review website\u2019. It was a guide with information required to decide where to order food from. We spruced it up by having practically all menus in any given geographical area. Based on feedback, we brought in pictures, maps and other relevant information. We created some smart filters on the website to help people make their searches relevant. We went few steps ahead by splitting the search results by delivery and dine-out. More relevance. A large number of users gave us feedback to create a review section and we did that. The focus was always, and will always be, to create a food guide, not just a \u2018review website\u2019. In fact, we were the first brand in India to bring the power of food search to the mobile via our smartphones apps.\nWhile we were creating and improving our products, we naturally got advertisers on board. That is the simplest way in which an aggregator like us makes money. Restaurant clients however, came to us with a variety of issues and sought help. None of us belonged to the hospitality industry and were clearly not qualified to help them. But we more than made up for it with logic and common sense \u2013 something that we still look for while getting people on board. We analyzed food search behavior and had hordes of data to validate our recommendations. Here\u2019s the long and short of it \u2013 sitting behind the curtain of a \u2018review website\u2019 are people who are problem solvers for the restaurant business. We offer a gamut of services which helps restaurants not only market themselves better, but also run their operations smoothly. We are business drivers. We charge a bomb for what we do \u2013 we value our intellect. This is clearly where we go much beyond any \u2018review website\u2019. We are not Zomato \u2018dot com\u2019, we are \u2018Zomato\u2019.\nRight now, Zomato is growing super fast and we need people who can grow faster than the organization. People who can figure out stuff by themselves and get things done. People who dream of running a company one day and want to get their hands dirty at running one right now.\nIf you think this is what you are made of, you should be here at Zomato. Here, there is always something fun, meaningful\u00a0and\u00a0i-m-possible to do. We are three years old and we are building things which will change the face of our industry. If you want to be a part of the change, and drive it, write in your motivation to me at\u00a0deepinder@zomato.com; please do not send your CVs \u2013 we don\u2019t look at them. Moreover, once you join Zomato, you will probably never need one again."

        "content": "I knew Zomato when it wasn\u2019t even Foodiebay. I saw it grow from the outside. And finally, bitten by the start-up bug, I jumped on the foodwagon.\nMy glistening new business card says \u201cVP \u2013 Operations\u201d. Read it as \u201cHR, Finance, Admin and handle all the shit for everyone\u201d.\nMonday, my Day Zero, I walk into office and recoil at the profusion of Oreo wrappers, Sony Vaio boxes and plates full of half-eaten Maggi. Before I go any further let me tell you that I am a control and cleanliness freak and such things just piss me off. So, I just search \u201chousekeeping services in Gurgaon\u201d, find a good one and ask them to come in at 8:30 the next morning. First thing done.\nAt 10am, I find my little just-out-of-college HR expert, Disha, bouncing with excitement and suspense. When you hire housekeeping, you fire the maid. \u201cYou do it, you do it\u201d \u2013 she said. Braving up for the situation, I delivered the maid the bad news and then spent the next 30 minutes trying to pacify her. Then finally, to compromise, I offer to let her do the dishes for a month. A notice period of sorts. Fair deal, right? Except that I find people laughing at me. Stupefied, I learn that maids don\u2019t usually get notice periods. They don\u2019t really need them. Point proven because I haven\u2019t seen her since. Oh and btw, the new housekeeping-guy is a big hit. I feel this crazy sense of achievement. The loo doesn\u2019t stink. There\u2019s plenty of toilet paper. Yay!\nLesson #1: There\u2019s no job too small, and no task too menial. Running an office is a full-time job and every little change drives happiness.\nThere\u2019s a tremendous sense of satisfaction when you get a cupboard cleaned, labeled and papered, and when someone happily grumbles at how the housekeeping-guy is ALWAYS cleaning under her feet.\nJust then, I hear Deepinder complaining \u2013 \u201cWe have been able to scale quite a few things, but we are still living on a total of 6 dustbins for the whole office!\u201d. Ah. Time to go shopping.\nAt Lifestyle, a fat lady ahead of me is buying 16 equally fat golden Buddhas (Diwali gifts). A hot-looking college student is buying fancy red nail stuff. I\u2019m standing there with my arms full of twelve orange and lime-green dustbins, one extra large stainless-steel dustbin, a bright red tray and 3 bright red plastic glasses (yup, pen-stands). I can just hear them saying \u2013 Weirdo! But public embarrassment gives me a kick. Lime green dustbins are so cool. I stare back at Miss Red Nails with full attitude.\nLesson #2: Admin tasks in a start-up can be injurious to public image.\nHR. What a deceptively short word for a grossly complex aspect of human work-life.\nI just asked a simple question from a set of people who are supposed to \u2018know\u2019 things: \u201cHow many people does this office have?\u201d\nDeepinder: Ummmm\nPankaj: Ummmm\nDisha: Ummmm\nThanks guys! Spiderman could well have said \u2013 with great growth comes great chaos. We scourge cupboards. We send emergency surveys. We walk around office with notepads. We count people across ten cities to finally, for the first time come up with the exact number.\nI was ok with all this until I got a call at midnight from Deepinder asking for the guest house keys. \u201cWhat! Why?!!\u201d I say. \u201cThey\u2019re with me but why do you need them?\u201d. \u201cSomeone just joined Zomato\u201d, I\u2019m told. I panic. Then the panic disappears because it suddenly dawns on me how a food-related start-up led by two (male) engineers works. Without the guest house keys, Vishal, our new joinee, bunks at a local hotel for the night. Next morning he checks the sheets (they exist), the loo (present) and the TV (damn! It doesn\u2019t work). Oh well! Life is sorted. Let\u2019s move on.\nLesson #3: Start-ups are like life. What can go wrong will go wrong (and much more besides). But it all gets sorted if you can keep a check on that panic button. Life is awesome when you wake up each morning and say \u201cAan de\u201d. You may get fired but you\u2019ll never get bored.\nThe HR role also entails CV screening and interviews. Sounds easy, right? Figure this \u2013 that first week we had 800 applications stuck in spam, hate mail on Facebook and Twitter and people telling us \u201cMen make rules and fools follow them\u201d when we sent an apologetic reject. Frustrated? You bet! Disha forced me to buy a paper shredder. She now shreds colored paper to cool down. I eat Maggi and Oreo cookies (dieting is impossible in foodie-start-ups). And we read yet another application that tells us three reasons why someone wants to join Zomato: a) Food! b) Food! c) Food!\n#wtf\nLesson #4: Working in a start-up is a fabulous life lesson in growing up. You mature, you handle pressure and you win! Nothing shocks you. Nothing brings you down. We fry our own eggs and they\u2019re always sunny side up.\nChange is a big part of my new world. I get an idea. I discuss it with a few people. I implement it. Things move really fast. Three new positions were created and closed this week, we drafted six finance policies, I attended my first ever investor update and I witnessed my first Zomato drunk party. Awesome!\nBut with rapid change comes honest (often brutal) feedback. I got my first feedback email 4 days into the job; an on-the-spot real-time verbal thrashing mid-training session (I was the trainer, mind you) and an online feedback session over Gtalk at 12:10 AM.\nLesson #5: Start-up people are VERY open and VERY honest. It\u2019s not sugarcoated corporate culture and it\u2019s not a place to chill. You develop a thick skin, fantastic personal growth and a grudging admiration for logical reasoning.\nNext week, on Monday morning, Deepinder says we need a Review Editor. On Tuesday afternoon the wish-list has a Video Animator. An experienced journalist mails us on Wednesday morning to check for a job, and on Wednesday evening she\u2019s our new PR Manager. Thursday brings demand for call-center support. And did I also mention we need a brushed metal Zomato logo for the office reception, file for ESI registration and get custom-built filing cabinets for the content team? But, we got shit done.\nLesson #6: Not knowing is not an excuse. If it has to get done, it has to get done. You just figure it out! Get creative, get aggressive, get social \u2013 do whatever!\nWe live in a pressure cooker and the whistle may go off any time. But it\u2019s positive pressure and that\u2019s why I want to wake up each morning and say \u2013 what next! There\u2019s so much to do, so much to learn, so much to know. And yet, I\u2019ve done so much already.\n18 days in a start-up. I\u2019ve been here 18 seconds and I\u2019ve been here 18 years.\n=========\nVrinda Singh graduated from LSR in 2008, and has worked at Bain and Company for more than 3 years before joining Zomato a few days ago."

        "author": "saurabhzomato",
        "content": "Today, we will share our learnings on how to be a pain in the a**e of your customers. After all, your brand is above all and no matter how much your customers resist, you must shove your brand down their throat. It is imperative that you prove your worth as an MBA by suggesting and implementing marketing techniques that irritate the hell out of the very people who are the reason for your survival.\nTechnique 1: SMS Blast\nThis is by far the most effective marketing technique to harass your customers. When done strategically (i.e. 6 smses per day for 30 days as prescribed by Dr Butt-ra), it ensures that your target of making 6 Lac impressions has been met. It is immaterial whether the sms-es are being deleted without being read \u2013 it is still counted as an impression thus contributing to your KRAs. In fact, your efforts, combined with that of the banks and telecom companies, ensure that all sms-es starting with AD-, TM-, etc reach your customers inbox by the dozen and they are prompted to activate DND. Irrespective of the result of this activity, you will sleep peacefully with a sense of accomplishment.\nTechnique 2: E-mail Blast\nThis technique is not as effective as the SMS Blast since the number of internet users (using e-mail) in India is much less than mobile subscribers. However, this technique is normally used to reach out to the \u201ccorporates\u201d and quite rightly so. The average IQ of a corporate office-goer is less than Paris Hilton\u2019s and they clearly have no sense of segregating spam from genuine mails. Also, Google\u2019s algorithm is outdated and cannot differentiate between the two. While you, the marketing stalwart, would normally delete promotional e-mails from unknown parties promptly from your inbox, you are right in assuming that the dumber ones out there don\u2019t do so. Here are the results of a survey we conducted: 1. 95% of respondents devote 1 hour at tea-time specifically browsing, categorizing, archiving and sharing all the promotional mails sent by you and several other brands. 72% of them are also willing to sacrifice their personal time for this activity. 2. 87% said that they can\u2019t figure out from the sender\u2019s name and subject that the mail is promotional in nature. 3. 79% said that they do not know how to \u201cReport Spam\u201d. They have been trying to trace the button for ages but haven\u2019t been able to do so. Clearly, people love your e-mail blasts. Continue the good work.\nTechnique 3: Weekly Newsletters\nThis marketing technique is used more as an engagement tool. It also serves as a reminder that the brand exists. Most of the content in such newsletters revolves around how to plan your weekend, best shopping deals, etc. Clearly, people out there have no idea on how to plan their weekends. What would they do without your newsletters? It makes perfect business sense to hire 3 people to create a newsletter which has an average impression time of 0.2 seconds per viewer. An additional recommendation from our side: Please hire 1 techie to create a force field around the newsletter which can penetrate spam blockers. It will ensure that the balance 90% users also get to see the newsletter. In fact, you along with other \u201cweekend guides\u201d offer multiple ways to plan weekends and it offers your users a gamut of choices to select the one that will go to the Trash Folder.\nTechnique 4: Pamphlets\nThis technique should be used so that we do not lose touch with our Indian Culture. It is important to continue certain traditions so that our coming generations can see how marketing was done before the internet came into being. People love collecting pamphlets. In fact, our survey revealed that more than 90% of people actually stack them in their living room to show-off to their guests. To our surprise, we also discovered that in 80% of these households, the homemaker or the housemaids were running a conspiracy to hide the pamphlets before they reach the reader terming them as trash. We interviewed few of them and they admitted that these pamphlets usually slipped out of the newspapers and fell on the ground where the sweeper would simply sweep them away. The ones who did get these pamphlets, would throw away the poor quality ones in the trash and save the ones which looked attractive. However, after a few hours, they could not recall where they had kept the piece of paper! And this is the most shocking result of the survey \u2013 76% percent of male respondents said that they hide the pamphlets before it reaches their wives because most of them carry attractive shopping offers! We\u2019ve only listed a few of the techniques which will help you gain stardom. Please feel free to add to this list so that us marketers can achieve marketing nirvana. [For the clueless, this post is pure sarcasm ;-)]"

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "We started experimenting with mobile phone apps in January 2011 when we launched the first ever \u201c2.0\u201d local search application for India. Since then, we have launched a series of apps for different platforms \u2013\n\u00a0\nBlackberry\n,\n\u00a0\niPhone\n,\n\u00a0\nNokia\n, Samsung Smart TV, Blackberry Playbook, Android Tabs.\nThe highest user adoption can be seen for Blackberry, Android and iPhone in that order. To understand user traction of each of these platforms for Zomato, it does not make sense for us to compare the total installed base \u2013 as the date of launch of each of these platforms were different. Also, Blackberry has been featuring our app frequently on the App World, which has given our installed base on their platform a significant push.\nApps are a win-win situation for developers, content providers as well as OEM platforms. But it is very important to look at where Indian developers should be prioritizing their time. Zomato could serve as a very good case study to look at and learn from. Here are some interesting and valuable numbers to look at:\nThese numbers are purely organic downloads (i.e. no paid ads, app store features are not included). Blackberry is certainly the most active consumer app ecosystem in India.\nThis is the average for active users within a month (i.e. # of visits/# of unique install loads).\n\u00a0\nNot\n\u00a0\na (# of visits / installed base) calculation. iOS significantly leads the way here. Clearly shows the \u2018propensity to spend\u2019 of iOS users vs Blackberry and Android users.\nAndroid users are spending the most amount of time picking up their next dining destination. Blackberry users seem to be \u2018busier\u2019 here. Also, conversion rates from all these platforms are roughly the same \u2013 lends significance to these numbers.\nThis chart is in sync with the chart above this. Blackberry users tend to decide quickly. iOS users are more picky \u2013 look up more restaurants before they decide. However, if you look at the last two charts together, you would also notice that iOS users tend to choose or dismiss a restaurant rather quickly \u2013 i.e. their average time spent per restaurant page is significantly lower.\nPlease note that these are relative numbers. Blackberry is 1, others are scaled accordingly. As you see, we get the most amount of user traction from our iOS users. However, since Blackberry has the largest installed base, it wins in the total number of mobile reviews we get per day.\nAnother useful metric to look at is the length of reviews.\niOS again wins hands down.\nPlease note that the source for all this analysis is internal download and usage tracking data.\n=============\nOverall, we think that if you are mobile developer, you should be targeting the Blackberry platform before anything else. The reach it brings to the table will surpass all the other benefits of being present on any other platform. Next in line should be iOS for the quality of traffic it gives you access to. Of course, then you should go for Android.\nAre you a mobile developer? What do you think?"

        "link": "https://zomatoblog.com/changing-zomatos-rating-system-2/",
        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "Starting with a small background, we have so far used a survey approach to rate restaurants for you \u2013 that is how you have seen each and every restaurant being rated on Zomato. Since we touch each restaurant physically, to collect menus and information, this used to be easy for us. We used to talk to a few customers sitting in a restaurant or coming out of a restaurant to fill a brief form for us such as this:\nNow, since we have around 18,000 listings, this is becoming an increasingly difficult task. Moreover, restaurants change, they change their menus, people, management, and what not. And any of these changes could have a significant impact on a customer\u2019s experience at these restaurants. For us, with this scale, it has been extremely difficult to keep our ratings updated. We try to do it once every 3 months, but that is a huge task.\nSo, we thought that we should ask for your help. While we will continue to follow a survey approach to ratings, we will ask for your help to keep these updated. With a very simple widget that will let you tell us how you would rate a restaurant. The average rating for a restaurant would be updated in front of your own eyes in real time. Every such move has its pros and cons. The biggest pro is that our ratings will have more \u2018votes\u2019 into them, so will be more authentic. In combination with reviews, it will give you the power of making a restaurant notice and pay attention to your feedback.\nCons \u2013 spam. For the first few weeks, we will have to be on our toes to prevent restaurant owners from rating their own restaurants well and bashing up their deserving competitors. Trust us when we say that even some of the best restaurants in town do such things. But hopefully, by now, we know such miscreants very well and should be able to spot them with just one eye open.\nIf you notice the survey form above, people very rarely fill or care about detailed ratings (food/service/ambience). All they are concerned about is the \u2018Overall Experience\u2019. And the overall rating of a restaurant very aptly sums it up. So in the name of making it simple, we are also doing away with detailed ratings. From now onwards, there is going to be just one global average (survey users). This is one change we are scared about the most, but also the one thing we think that makes the most amount of sense.\nAlso, this is just Step 1 of giving our users more power to control the content on Zomato. In line with our API launch, it opens up the platform to so many more possibilities. For all the developers using our API, this feature will also be rolled out on the API in a few days time (you should get an email when we do that)."

        "content": "We were very visibly irritated when we found a handful of our listings on Burrp. And given what has conspired in the last two days, it led to an extreme amount of tension between the two companies. Neither of us want to pursue this further, because such conflicts can actually (and usually) bring a budding enterprise down. In this case, there are two such companies at stake.\nOver the last two days, we have been talking to Burrp (a lot!) over the phone and we reached a consensus that pushing this further doesn\u2019t make sense for anyone. If you run a listings based business, you will know that there are ten thousand potential process glitches which can lead to some unwanted data creeping into your website. Any such process glitch, without any malicious intention of the stakeholders, can lead to trouble with data being shown on the website.\nOver the last two days, we have been assured by Burrp that the Zomato listings being found out on Burrp were not intentionally copied. They were done by a couple of rogue data collection agents who have been identified and trained to not do such things again. After all, for a listings based company, it does not make sense to go after copying someone else\u2019s data. For now, we believe what Burrp is saying and agree that there were some process glitches which led to this mishap. The team at Burrp very forthrightly and politely offered to work with us to remove these listings from their website. We have both agreed that we will work together and remove all such listings on Burrp within a reasonable timeframe. Both the companies agree that they quickly need to get back to do what they do best \u2013 run their businesses.\nSo, for the record, everything\u2019s fine between Zomato and Burrp for now. Tomorrow onwards, we will be back to doing what we do best. And not spend time on something which we never thought would become such a big issue."

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "We have 18,000 currently open restaurants listed on Zomato. Given that we have 98% menu cards, and complete information for every restaurant that is listed with us, anybody can see that this is a huge amount of information to collect and manage. And the fact that we update all this information every 3 months doesn\u2019t make our job any easier. This includes going traveling in scorching heat from restaurant to restaurant, collect their information, and put it online. Right now, we have 30 committed people in our content team who do this day in and day out. To bring the best information to our users, without fail, over and over gain. Let me tell you that it is a hard and thankless job. Only someone who has done it can really appreciate the toil which our people go through to get this done. I have been a proponent of taking the \u2018high road\u2019 and have gone through a lot of pain to build what we have in the form of Zomato. Therefore, it is very painful to see all this work being copied by someone else blatantly. I would have ideally let it go if it were only my effort being copied here, but I had to post this to boost the morale of our content team which was obviously furious and dejected when parts of their hard work showed up on a competing website. Before I go explain how Burrp did this to us, let me give you a small background. Any local search company such as ours, most of the times has unique/proprietary data points being shown on the website. These data points are proprietary to the business in a manner of representation and/or collection and any malicious competitor activity can be easily tracked when these data points show up on their website. We have been experimenting with a few business models and have for a few restaurants put our own phone numbers on which we take table reservations on behalf of the restaurant. These instances are very few in number (~1% of our database). So these numbers are our numbers, the restaurant staff doesn\u2019t know about this and these numbers have no business showing up on some other website (even our API does not serve these numbers). Also, we have our own proprietary GPS systems which help us collect very very accurate (within 2 meters) GPS coordinates for restaurants listed on Zomato. So when these coordinates, until the 5th decimal point show up on some other website, we have a problem. Now, we found a few such instances on Burrp.com; these instances are incomplete listings (Burrp didn\u2019t take our data which they thought would be proprietary), but these listings on Burrp have our phone numbers and our GPS coordinates in them. Here is a screenshot:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNote: I have saved snapshots of these Burrp pages on Freezepage at these URLs:\u00a0\nZinos on Burrp on Freezepage\n\u00a0\nMangal\u2019s Profile on Burrp on Freezepage\n\u00a0Btw, we found these listings by doing a simple \u201csite:burrp.com 49422222\u201d search on Google. 49422222 is a Zomato owned phone number in Delhi. We have found multiple other such instances on Burrp. Now, we have pointed out such issues to Burrp twice earlier and the response we got was:\nNow, this is not a user upload. The \u2018user\u2019 who added this listing is a Mangal84, who has added 11052 listings to Burrp (yet) with 0 reviews (!). Clearly a Burrp employee, since May 5, 2009. More about it here:\n\u00a0\nhttp://www.linkedin.com/pub/mangal-shewale/23/519/867\n\u00a0\nor\n\u00a0\nhttp://www.freezepage.com/1316835281MDMFHBHHQU\n\u00a0\nWith user uploads, I can understand, shit happens. But even then, you just cannot pass off shit in the name of user uploads. It\u2019s a well known fact that Burrp verifies and moderates every listing upload that is submitted on the website. How could such a thing get through the moderation and verification system? So, if it is indeed some users uploading Zomato data to Burrp\u2019s servers, we strongly recommend that Burrp should either strengthen its moderation systems or shut down the sections of its business which they clearly cannot manage. What I have not been able to understand is the map coordinates available for a few restaurants on their system. I don\u2019t really think that a user would go to the extent of going through our source code, extracting the map coordinates and submitting them to Burrp. As far as I know Burrp doesn\u2019t even have a facility to submit raw map coordinates. And I think there is only a one in a million chance that the user accidentally dropped a pin on a google map which is exactly the same as the super accurate coordinates collected with our GPS systems. I would like to give Burrp the benefit of doubt, but it is highly unlikely that a user is doing this. As shown above, its quite likely that a Burrp employee is behind all this scraping from Zomato. A lot of local search companies manually keep a check on each other for research. Its what everybody calls competitor research. Its done to keep track of things that are going on and new businesses that are coming up. Once any new activity is spotted, the company\u2019s own data collection engine kicks in and gets the information on its own (in a proprietary way) to provide to the user the value that they stand for. Its extremely sad to see such a great product like Burrp resorting to such things to keep itself alive. We used to really respect Burrp for what they have achieved. Now, I would really recommend Burrp to use our API, and at least power its restaurant section data with our content in a clean (and legal) way. Overall, we don\u2019t and can\u2019t really know the extent to which our content has been copied (or uploaded by users!), we are afraid that this might be a large amount of content. It hurts us in our organic search engine rankings, make us lose traffic (directly and indirectly), and also hurts the morale of our team. Given the amount of effort we put into Zomato, there is no way we are going to take this lying down.\n\u00a0\n[Note: I would request the Burrp team not to pin this on Mangal. I am sure she is doing what she has been told to do by her bosses at Burrp or doing what she has not been told to avoid.]"

        "content": "Note: most of this blog post is centered around the internal debate regarding whether we should make our API public or not.\n\u00a0\nWe almost forgot that we announce major feature updates and releases here on the blog. Perils of having a busy life and growing faster than you can handle. Well, we now have the\n\u00a0\nZomato API\n\u00a0\nfinally released for developers to integrate Zomato content in their applications. We had been receiving quite a lot of requests from the developer community for almost an year now, and trust me when I say that building and rolling this out was one helluva difficult job. For two primary reasons:\nThe API had to be robust\nMost of our website code is not robust; we barely survive on an everyday basis.. there are bug reports and crashes and fixes everyday, we have learnt to live with them and after so many years, things are finally starting to look better. We could not do this to our API; since an API very quickly becomes a standard and when people other than your own team start using your code, you have very little flexibility to change stuff realtime. We started developing the\n\u00a0\nAPI\n\u00a0\naround an year ago \u2013 tested it out with our own mobile apps \u2013 our Android app which was out in January 2011 was running on the same API. Some partners who trusted our team (Makemytrip, Mapmyindia \u2013 thankyou!) helped us take the\n\u00a0\nAPI\n\u00a0\nlive with their own applications and had us test it for scalability. Net result \u2013 our API is now very fast and can handle 10,000 requests a second without blinking a processor core! All our apps are built using the same API (of course, with some additional privileges, which keep our own apps exclusive).\nIntense internal debate\nThere is always the data security threat when you do something like launching a public API. And as always, there were two warring camps within Zomato, one for and the other against this move.\nThe logic of the camp against this move:\nLogic 1:\n\u00a0\nThis will result in a zillion sites which will replicate our data and result in loss of traffic for us; also result in noise in the market which could be a temporary loss for our sales force.\n\u00a0\nCounterlogic:\n\u00a0\nAny new venture which wants to steal our data will not need our API to do it. They can use custom crawlers to do it. Heck, the labor rate in India is so low, humans crawling the website and copy pasting data will be cheaper than building a custom crawler. So we don\u2019t have to worry about miscreants. They have always been and will always be there.\n\u00a0\nLogic 2:\n\u00a0\nSome of our competitors might use our API to update their own outdated data, and when they use our data, their sites will suddenly start looking better, giving us a run for our own money.\n\u00a0\nCounterlogic:\n\u00a0\nMost of our (serious) competitors are mature enough to not resort to such things. Anyways, to pre-empt that, we have built custom bugs in the content served to API users (yes, 0.5% of the data being served through our API is intentionally wrong), which will help us recognize and prove that this data was originally ours. Since we will have algorithmic proof to generate the data being shown on such competitor websites.\n\u00a0\nLogic 3:\n\u00a0\nDo we have serious developers in the ecosystem who can come up with brilliant uses of our content?\n\u00a0\nCounterlogic:\n\u00a0\nMore than enough of them. Anyways, some of the largest users of our API will be bigger companies like Makemytrip, Mapmyindia and upcoming augmented reality startups like Mateongo. Moreover, since this blog post is a little late, I am happy to report than more than 40 developers have already requested for our test API key to develop innovative local apps :-).\n\u00a0\nLogic 4:\n\u00a0\nWe don\u2019t get anything out of it.. do we?\n\u00a0\nCounterlogic:\n\u00a0\nWe get to create an eco-system of developers and apps who use our content and also help us create content for our platform. More content = happier customers. Happier customers = more customers. More customers is what everybody wants. Counterlogic won."

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "We get this a lot of times \u2013 \u201cWhen are you going to start offering daily deals on restaurants?\u201d. And we being quite in favor of \u2018once and for all\u2019, decided to write about this so that we can simply point people to this blog post when someone asks us this question next. If you have been following us, you know know that a few months ago, we made our foray into Group Buying with the launch of Zodeals.com. It was an April Fool\u2019s joke [;-)], but honestly, we have been toying with the idea for quite some time now. Given our customer base, it seems like an obvious extension of our business model. However, we decided not to be impulsive and figure out what this Group Buying business model is really about and how it affects customers and businesses. Btw, we love discounts. Who doesn\u2019t? Lately, Group Buying and Daily Deal sites have been trying to pamper us with mind-boggling discounts (95% being the highest we\u2019ve seen). While the consumer is very very happy, little light is thrown on how it affects businesses who sponsor them. Also, not much is known about the health of the numerous deal sites in the Indian market with little or no differentiation. While some of these sites have already moved into discounting products (phones, camera etc..), we were curious to know how their offers on services (restaurants, spas etc..) were doing. Because that (restaurant deals) is what is relevant to Zomato. In its current form, the concept of online group buying became popular in the US with Groupon. Groupon enables buyers to purchase items at throwaway prices thanks to \u201ccollective bargaining power\u201d. What the seller loses in margins gets partially compensated by volumes and new footfall. Pretty straightforward. It is one of the marketing activities used by businesses to speed up the rate of customer acquisition. Also, it is used by businesses to fill up unused inventory and hence recover a portion of their fixed costs. So if executed in the right way, for some businesses, there is a very clear upside in offering such a deal. To decide whether we should move into this adjacency, we thought of talking to a few business owners about their perceived value of daily deal sites. We selected 20 restaurant owners (all of them are already our clients at Zomato) who had at some point, experimented with group buying websites. And yes, 20 is a good enough sample set for a startup business like ours to get to a decision. (Seriously) The key message we got is that business owners believe or are made to believe that their Target Group (TG) loves discounts and will flock their shop to avail it. Yes, in most cases people do turn up in decent numbers. But here\u2019s the catch \u2013 most (17 out of 20) business owners now feel that the customers who turned up are actually not their TG. They are a set of deal hunters who would never buy their products at normal prices. To help you understand this better \u2013 imagine this \u2013 if you are a group buying customer and paid Rs. 250 for a Spa during the deal days, will you ever pay Rs. 1000 at the\u00a0\nsame\n\u00a0Spa a month later? Or will you hunt for a heavily discounted deal at some other spa? Wharton marketing professor David Reibstein seems to agree:\n\u201cUnfortunately, the people Groupon is attracting are those who are referred to as \u201cdeal prone customers\u201d \u2014 who are, to put it differently, price-sensitive customers. These customers tend not to be the most loyal of customers. And because you have attracted them with a low price, you are more likely to lose them because somebody else offers a lower price. The merchant might say, \u201cWell I am not making money on these customers, but hopefully I am building some future business.\u201d But there is the challenge of whether they are really building future business, because what they really getting is a fickle customer. Merchants are going to discover that the Groupon customer is not where you build your future business. Therefore, the savvy merchants are going to learn that this is not a good way for them to do business.\u201d\nSource:\u00a0\nKnowledge@Wharton\n\u00a0To summarize our discussions with the 20 restaurant owners, all of them said that they do not think there is any long term value in going for a group buying deal, because most of the customers who bought the deal did not show up at their restaurants more than once. They now realize that the TG of a business comprises of people who can actually afford the place even when there is no discount. After all, how long can a business continue deep discounting? A couple of weeks perhaps. At most a month. Not beyond this because there\u2019s a significant cost (discount) attached to the deal. Thereafter, the business has to sustain on the basis of customers who can pay their rack prices. Our clients also agreed that their brand hardly got exposed to this \u2018real\u2019 TG during the deal days. Instead, it gets exposed majorly to people whose loyalty is to the discount and not the brand. The day the deal is off, these people shift their loyalty to the next place offering similar services at a deep discount. We also decided to look at the unit economics currently at play, and interviewed a former Daily Deal Salesman (who could give us more dope on the business model). Here is how the conversation went: Q: \u201cHow much money did you make per client?\u201d A: \u201cThe last deal I made was to sell a Rs 600/- buffet at Rs 250/-. Our commission was Rs. 50/- and the merchant kept Rs. 200/-\u201d Q: \u201cHow many coupons got sold during the deal?\u201d A: \u201c50. That means I bring in 50 x Rs. 50/- = Rs 2500/- for my company\u201d Q: \u201cHow many such deals would you need to do to recover your own salary plus some overheads?\u201d A: \u201cAt least 20 per month to recover my salary and overhead\u2026which is not easy.I could never imagine my individual contribution to revenue touching a lakh of rupees in a month. That effectively means there\u2019s a cap on my commission.\u201d This daily deal salesman is a great chap and is doing very well as part of our sales team. Overall, we think that in India, the current group buying sourcing and distribution model does not always work for the services industry. In some cases, it does, but mostly, it does not. Our conclusion is that we will wait until we find that perfect sourcing and distribution model which will keep the unit economics low and will provide long term sustainable value to customers as well as businesses."

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "Zomato today is one of the biggest restaurant and food portals in the country. So much so, that we can also compare our traffic and scale to some of our global counterparts. So we must have done some things right, and I really hope that we continue to do these things in the future. While I do not really know what these things are that went our way, we have certainly learnt a lot during our journey. And we learnt most of these lessons the hard way \u2013 by getting things wrong (yeah, like obstinate kids).\nThought it might be valuable to share some of these \u2018early-stage\u2019 lessons with everyone else. Some of these things may sound cliche, but they are very relevant. And the fact that we got these trivial things wrong make them so much more important to take care of. So here we go:\nIt\u2019s not about ideas. It\u2019s about making them happen\nI know you have heard this from a lot of people. But still, I repeat. It is all about execution. And this could not be more true than in the case of Zomato. What we are doing is not at all path breaking. It is certainly not new. But what we have done is better than most others have done (we get this from our customers). I often go pitch to potential clients and I get this question from a lot of them \u2013 \u2018How are you different from XYZ?\u2019. I could go about telling them that we have this and that on our website, but I choose a very short answer \u2013 \u2018We\u2019re not different. We are better. And we have a million customers every month to speak for us\u201d. This answer always hits the right spot with everyone.\nListen to others\u2026 and don\u2019t.\nChoose the right people to listen to. A lot of people give advice to entrepreneurs. Most of them tend to think that they know how to run your business better than you do. They try to put themselves in your shoes and start telling you how they would run your business. All in the name of advice. Entrepreneurs should be very careful to pick up the right advice and discard the ones which doesn\u2019t feel right. At the end of the day, you have to do what you believe in. Not something someone else believes in.\nAnd eventually, it all comes down to focus. Rely on your instincts and keep pushing on what you are doing. Listen to others. Tweak, don\u2019t change. Keep pushing.\nTake a few steps back\nIn a startup, things move at a breakneck speed. A month in a startup is in my opinion equal to a year of work in a big setup. In this scenario, it becomes very important for the founding team to pause once every few months and look at how the company is doing. In consulting jargon, we call it \u2018taking a step back\u2019. Every time we have taken a step back, we ended up preparing our team to take big leaps into the future. Such breaks help re-prioritize business objectives and also bring fresh thinking into a startup. We are currently in the middle of a break. We are not getting much work done, but are quite happy sketching the future of Zomato.\nChoose the right people to work with\nThe amount of work needed to be done in a startup quickly grows beyond what just the founding team can do. It therefore, becomes super important to build a rock solid team. Getting good people to work with you is extremely difficult. You have to hire people by looking them in the eye, ask them to quit their current jobs, join you for a lesser salary, for a big amount of risk, for equity which does not yet exist and for a product which does not \u2018yet\u2019 have a large customer base.\nYou have to find and grow people who can think like owners. People who believe that this is the last job that they will ever do. We have a group of 60 people who love doing what they do and love working with the people they work with. Getting this right sets the stage for a startup.\nMoney solves only a single problem\nAnd that\u2019s money. Everything else remains the same. Before we had our first round of funding, we were literally running the show on a shoestring budget. We often used to think that funding would solve most of problems \u2013 hiring, marketing, selling. It didn\u2019t. . A lot of our first few hires didn\u2019t work out well \u2013 We hired some for the wrong reasons. Some joined us for the wrong reasons.\nOn that note, bootstrapping works. In my opinion, that is the only way to build robust companies. And luckily, we have investors who believe in the same. We now hire someone only when we cannot find a reason not to hire that person and when we also absolutely need that person. We diligently track the ROI on all our marketing spend. And we train the shit out of our sales team.\nWe started making more mistakes after we had some money. Luckily, we had everything back under control in a few months and are now back to a bootstrapping culture. And we are doing much better.\nSay and do what you believe in\nAs a startup, we all believe what we are building. And to keep up the spirits, we get a lot of emails from our customers everyday thanking us for what we are doing. As a group, we do what we believe in and stay away from everything that does not appeal to our conscience.\nOver the last 3 years, we have never cheated our customers and have never lied to our clients or investors. We intend to keep it that way. We have certainly had some short term losses for sticking to our guns, but are sure that this will pay off in the longer term.\nOn that note, it is very important to align everyone in your organization to the same goals and beliefs, if they don\u2019t, you need to train your team better!\nCare for your team\n9 in 10 startups fail. Our startup might just be one of them. And our team is what we will end up with.\nCaring for your people will ensure something very important \u2013 that everybody puts in their best. And that\u2019s the best anyone can do for anything at all.\nHave a great support system\nI meet a lot of people who start-up without the close support of their friends and family. That is, in my opinion, a time bomb. It builds a lot of pressure for an individual and eventually leads to a breakdown. Luckily, we had a great support system behind us. Families who supported us to give up our cushy jobs and go after what we wanted. Friends who believed in us and lent us their savings without asking us too many questions. It would have been impossible to build whatever little we have so far without them.\nAlways take the high-road\nThere have been a lot of instances when we have had to confront not only new, but highly established competition on social media. We have always believed in taking the high road and have never thrown dirt at competition unless there is a big enough reason to do so.\nIf you believe any publicity is good publicity and that your competitor talking about you will get you more eyeballs, you are wrong. What your customers think of your brand is more important than what you competition says about you."

        "author": "Pankaj Chaddah",
        "content": "Hundreds of people have asked us this question (sometimes over and over again): \u201cWhy don\u2019t you start accepting online orders on behalf of restaurants?\u201d My answer is no \u2013 we will not accept online orders, not yet! And here\u2019s why. Looking at us, we might come across as lazy people who don\u2019t want to get involved in all that tough operational stuff. Although a large part of that argument is absolutely true (I am lazy and Deepinder has a well-rounded tummy), the fact still remains that online ordering cannot work unless:\nAll sort of customizations are removed from the universe of cooking. I am talking about the preferences of \u2018having it our way\u2019 \u2013 extra salt, more or less spicy, extra onions on the side, extra green chutney and what not!\nThe mouse pointer that clicks on menu items in an online menu is treated to be as authentic as a real voice over the phone which persuasively says: \u201cbhaiya please jaldi bhej dena!\u201d (It would be great if you could send the food really quickly!). This is perhaps as good as removing everything human from the entire concept of food.\nLet me elaborate on the points mentioned above. The time needed to communicate all those personal preferences and the call that the restaurant makes to ensure whether the order placed online is genuine or not, are bound to extend the delivery time by at least 10 to 15 minutes. We always order food only when we start feeling hungry, and any sort of delay beyond 40-45 minutes starts annoying us. It\u2019s human tendency. Ask yourself \u2013 when was the last time you ordered food 1 hour before you started feeling hungry? Probably never\u2026\nAnother question we\u2019re asked frequently is: \u201cWhat do you say to the recent trend of all major brands offering an online ordering option?\u201d When we talk about Domino\u2019s, Pizza Hut, McDonald\u2019s, or KFC \u2013 you really can\u2019t and don\u2019t need to make any customization to the standard dishes they offer \u2013 so for this particular question, my first argument in the first paragraph goes for a toss. But the one about the authenticity and genuineness of a customer still holds true, right? It\u2019s exactly why these major brands make a confirmation call to the customer whenever an online order is placed \u2013 isn\u2019t the whole purpose of having an online ordering option lost if you are going to talk over the phone anyway? And an online ordering platform can\u2019t guarantee delivery within 30-35 minutes either. Hence proved, and as my Physics teacher would say, \u201cQuite Easily Done\u201d (English for \u201cQED\u201d in theorem proving language, \u201cQuod Erat Demonstrandum\u201d in Latin!) Now it makes me wonder, why are Domino\u2019s, Pizza Hut and the like offering online ordering if they can\u2019t match the standard of services over the phone? I don\u2019t have anything against the whole concept of online booking; in fact, I love how cab companies are incentivizing online bookings, but I find the current trend of online food ordering nothing but a mere marketing gimmick to create a buzz amongst consumers. \nNow coming to solutions \u2013 brands that don\u2019t offer the option for consumers to customize their orders can perhaps manage online orders very effectively by implementing credit card payments and targeting sloppy bachelors (like me) suffering from \u201clack of cash at home\u201d issues. But again, for that I need to be ready as a consumer to pay in advance for something that is perishable, and possesses a chance of being delivered when it\u2019s cold and inedible. But a solution for thousands of other restaurants who are always making small customizations \u2013 and have their customers saying \u201cIf you put coriander on the dishes, I am going to return the food!\u201d \u2013 is yet to be seen in the online ordering model. \nBefore parting, let me present some facts on how most online ordering websites work in India. Their back-end is a call center. So when a customer places an online order, the website\u2019s call center calls up the restaurant to place the order on behalf of the customer, and in many cases they also call the customer to verify the customer\u2019s identity. It sometimes makes me wonder about the problems or the customer needs that these businesses are even trying to address. The only one I see is that they are enabling online payments for people who don\u2019t have cash at home, but is even that being properly addressed? I seriously doubt it. Having said that, we might go into online ordering some time down the line. We would love to provide an end to end service to our beloved customers. But with the current state of affairs, if we enable online ordering now, we see ourselves running into problems bigger than the ones we will be trying to solve."

Everyone has to communicate constantly\u201d.\nThese are the only lines which caught my attention in the boring business article I was reading while flying back from Mumbai to Delhi. I thought to myself, \u201cHey Sales is not much different as one has to constantly communicate and communicate effectively\u201d. Sales is almost like Maths only the ones who know how to do it will love it and rest will hate it. My name is Vikas and I\u2019m going to talk to you about Sales in Zomato. A job I do and a job I love doing.\nWhat is Sales?\nI often refer to a scene from the movie \u201cThe Pursuit of Happyness\u201d where in an epic scene :- Chris Gardner (Will Smith) runs from the police station for his interview dressed inappropriately and tries to defend himself.\u00a0He starts by saying \u201cI am a type of person, if you ask me a question and I don\u2019t know the answer, I am going to tell you that I don\u2019t know, but I bet I know how to find the answer and I will find the answer.\u201d\u00a0To what the Interviewer asks \u201cChris what would say if a guy walked into an interview without a shirt on? and I hired him, what would you say? \u201d Chris Gardner \u201cHe must have had some really nice pants on.\u201d That\u2019s it right there \u2013 A Sale. Wikipedia defines Sales as an act of selling products or services in return for compensation usually monetary. Selling just does not mean selling X product to Y Customer only. You can sell anything. And everyone does sales directly. They just don\u2019t see it that way.\u00a0You can sell your qualities to an Interviewer for a getting a job. You can sell the idea of \u201cBungee jumping not being crazy\u201d to your parents. You can even try to sell a lie to your girlfriend \u201cthat she is the most beautiful girl you ever met\u201d (My girlfriend is btw). We all keep selling our ideas, decisions, beliefs to other people on a day to day basis without even knowing it.\nSelling can\u2019t be taught but learned\nSelling can never be taught but most definitely can be learned. If you think you have to study Master in Business Administration or do a major in Sales to become a top sales person you are sorely mistaken. The degree might help you to get a bigger picture of what the market is about and give you a better perspective of things, it might teach you 100 theories, scenarios, case-studies but it will never teach you how to sell.\u00a0Sales is like \u201cActing\u201d. You either have an aptitude to act or you can\u2019t. This is the raw talent part. Those who think they can acquire the skills by going to some acting/sales school or just reading some books are fooling themselves into thinking pure method can bring them greatness. I strongly believe it\u2019s something you either have or you don\u2019t. You can learn the rules, the product details, the dos and don\u2019ts but it is very important to be natural which is very vital both in Acting and Sales. There is actually no book of rule which teaches you all the guidelines as most of your learning is self-acquired and it comes naturally to you while dealing with real-time situations. Let me take another example. Clay Pottery. Everyone can be given the same amount of clay, told what to make in the exact right amounts, spin the right amount but it\u2019s almost always impossible to tell someone what to make. The set of skills/pitch is up to the Potter or Salesman to mould into which shape/words to satisfy the client. Sales is not easy to do. Sales needs vision and sales needs you to be constantly on your toes.\nThe view on Sales\nSales, though, is not rocket science however which is beyond the reach of mere mortals. It cannot be taught, but it can be learned. Most of us can pick up on it. It\u2019s all about perspective and how you view it.\u00a0On the one hand it could be just talking, proving your point and getting your client to agree to your terms. On the other it means stealing lots of money from the other person\u2019s pocket. Like a legal thief. You have a commission to go and convince the other guy to give you his money. I can name so many people who studied business & sales but cannot even sell to save their lives but some of the best sales people manage to sell their concepts on a day to day basis without studying a single word. You know who these people are? You see them on the road everyday. They are known as \u201cBeggars\u201d who sell their misery to us and most of us buy it, not because we are great human beings but because they are great salespeople. Radical isn\u2019t it?\nSo how can I get good at sales?\nEssential qualities needed to be a good salesman someone asked me once. I think there are quite a few.\nBeing many animals:-\u00a0\nIf I had to compare a perfect salesman to an animal I wouldn\u2019t be able to. Thus I would like borrow certain characteristics of a few animals which I think is required to make a perfect Salesman, inspired by our article on\n\u00a0Startups need Assasins\n. A perfect Salesman should be able to adapt or change his pitch as fast as the chameleon changes its colour. A Salesman\u2019s persistency to cold-call, follow up, and to haunt the client for those promised cheques should be no less than a woodpecker who keeps hammering that tree over and over again. A Salesman should be as patient as a crocodile that waits for his prey to be vulnerable before going for the kill. A Perfect Salesman should always know how to switch between an aggressive Tiger and a calm Elephant depending on the demanding situation.\nBeing proficient in communication:-\u00a0\nA Salesman has to be very proficient in whatever language he or she chooses to communicate in. He should also be a very good at presentation. Most people take you seriously only if your presentation is good. It reminds me of the fact of how a Salesman should also possess traits of a TV-Journalist as most of the times they themselves have no idea what they are talking about but it is the way they present it which is so intriguing that our minds end up believing them. Sales is not very different as most of the times Salesmen tends to overstate the quality of their product and creates a dream like image of their product, in the end it is really not the product which the client is interested in but the dream which the salesman puts in his head. That is exactly why I have always said that \u201cSelling does not merely mean selling a product but a belief and the one who knows how to sell that can sell anything\u201d\nListening always: \u2013\u00a0\n\u00a0One of the most important qualities a Salesman should possess, which most of \u00a0them lack including me, is a good pair of ears. A good salesman always gives the other party a chance to speak and put their point forward so they know what the client requires and what exactly to give him.\nBeing an optimist:-\u00a0\nLast but not the least I think a salesman should be an \u201cUber Optimist\u201d towards everything. Whenever a client says \u201cLet me think about it\u201d \u201cI will get back to you\u201d \u201cLet me mull over it \u00a0\u201cSend me a proposal\u201d I personally take it very positively and feel half my job is done and consider them as potential deals. Nobody will tell you right away \u201cGreat I am doing it\u201d \u201cOh Sure bring it On.\u201d. The ones who will are probably having \u201cfun\u201d with you. There would be times when not one , not two but all five people you were planning to call will not pick up your calls one after the other and you will feel as if they were all sitting in one common room cracking jokes, laughing at you for calling them one after the other. There would be times when you will have the appointment and suddenly your client will \u201cget stuck somewhere\u201d. There will be times when you will be at the client\u2019s doorstep to collect that cheque he has been promising you from 3 weeks and as soon as the big moment will arrive your client will make a stupid face and say \u201cOh yaar meri Cheque book hi ghar gayi, koi baat nai mein courier karwadoonga\u201d to which you should always smile back and say \u201cOh hoo..koi baat nahi mein phir ajaunga lene aap batao kab ana hai\u00a0?\u201d There will be times when clients will say \u201cYaar Vikas mein thoda late hojaunga traffic mein phasa hua hoon aap ko nikalna hai toh nikal jao \u201c to which you say \u201cno problems buddy I have lots of friends in the area I am chilling around you tell me whenever you are here\u201d .\nIn Conclusion\u00a0\nIt is very important to stay positive, stay focused and believe in yourself otherwise a job in sales could be very frustrating because even the best of salesmen are not going to crack a deal everyday. It\u2019s a battle out there for almost everything whether it\u2019s the first meeting, whether it\u2019s about an agreement, whether it\u2019s the prices or whether it is about collecting the payments. An average Salesman wakes up every morning to meet a complete stranger to argue and fight with him for no reason but to sell. Sales people have to prove themselves over and over again, quarter after quarter in order to earn that salary and the company\u2019s revenue. Something which is not always a direct cause for concern in many other positions where if one learns the ropes, one can settle down and relax at some point but in sales it\u2019s a perpetual demand for more , more and more. Know the three most important things about Sales:- 1. It is NOT a Sale until your cheque clears in the bank. 2. It is NOT a Sale until your cheque clears in the bank. 3. It is NOT a Sale until your cheque clears in the bank. Sales does NOT happen overnight and it is a long process of \u201cfrom fixing up a meeting to meeting to convincing the client to signing the contract to collecting payments\u201d The only key to achieve it is to never give up. Keep pushing it as much as you can without being disrespectful to the client and treat every meeting as your last meeting and give it the best you can.\nReally in conclusion\u00a0\nAs Jim Rohn says \u201cyou don\u2019t get paid for the hour. You get paid for the value you bring to the hour\u201d. As you notice I am a salesman because I can\u2019t seem to talk or write about sales so I\u2019ll end with the most ignored truth about Sales. It is all about hard work and lots of luck! You have to be with the right person at the right time. I would say 50% counts for your effort and the rest 50% on your luck. If you are a good salesman you will always convert the 50% luck favouring you into a 100% sale with your smart work. Why don\u2019t you excuse me now I have to make a call to my client! Thanks."

        "content": "The advantages of a startup over a big ass company.\nAt first thought, I wanted to name this article after the famous Munni vs Shiela debate. I felt it deserved such recognition since this is a topic, which has been debated by random famous people even before I was born. However, the tech team at Zomato forced me to name it in its current state for some SEO reasons. So be it \ud83d\ude00\nHere goes my point of view\u2026\nAdvantages of the Big Ass Company (henceforth renamed MNC or multi national corporation to not offend anyone anywhere)\n\u00b7\u00a0\nOffers you a secure job\u2026Majority of people, both on and off-campus, are always on the lookout for a reputed company to get into for different reasons. It comes with a reputation that has been built over several years and you can bank on it to provide a perfect platform to build your career. You can safely say that a Multi National Corporation (to be on the safe side and use less swearing) comes with a job warranty for the next 3-4 years unless you decide to go wild and run naked in your customer\u2019s/your office. Which is another post, but not advised to do here.\n\u00b7Financial stability and rewards\u2026MNCs can pay\u2026a lot! So much so that sometimes it won\u2019t even make sense to you why they do so. But it is a win-win situation for both you and the company. While it is highly likely that this pay indirectly drives your job security (maybe satisfaction too), it helps the company to retain their employees longer. Rewards such as annual bonus further ups your financial outlook and you also get to celebrate your work and the results through 3-4 social events during the year. You will feel like you are part of a very large happy family. Reminds me of a famous movie called Hum Saath Saath Hain.\nHowever, the company has a large say on how you work\u2026 Entering a MNC means that you enter into a system that has a pre-defined working culture. In addition to that, there is an expectation that you follow certain broad guidelines at all times. Possibly one of the reasons why they pay you high too. While they are not imposed directly, you often get to hear it in the form of \u201cIf you do these things, you will progress here\u201d or \u201cIf I were you, I would do it this way\u201d. It is probably the reason why it is tough to see that your work actually contributed to the result. These guidelines, which have been developed and perfected over time, are the backbone of company\u2019s reputation and help them in differentiating from competitors. You either fit into it or stand out; the choice is yours because you can\u2019t expect a kraantikaari badlaav in a MNC can you?\nLearning and/or career growth gets slow with time\u2026Your career progression at first might seem glamorous with all the title changes. However, they are tenure-based atleast for the first few years and then they stretch out. Even with a new title, you could pretty much be sitting on the same desk and doing the same work you did last year. Similarly, even the pace at which you learn or develop professional skills starts to decline very quickly. The pace is curbed largely due to the complex and sometimes unnecessary hierarchical structure, which does not give you the opportunity to exercise your full potential. In such a complex structure, your career growth is often decided very subjectively but that is something that works best in such a system.\nAdvantages of working for a small energized company (hereby referred to as a startup and here we don\u2019t offend anyone anyway)\n\u00b7You are responsible for your job security\u2026There is no 3-4 year warranty offered in a startup world. On the other hand the onus is largely upon you to work on how you want it to look 1 year from now, what all you want to work on and how to get there. Your ideas, your work, and everything you do everyday adds to building a secure foundation for the startup and if it does not, then you probably need to reconsider your decision.\n\u00b7In a startup, work is your reward\u2026A startup is not the right place for you if you expect the same pay scale as an MNC. What a startup offers is very rare and more valuable \u2013 a chance to pursue what you love doing working together with some of the most brilliant strong willed people and for some that beats any pay scale any day. When you pursue what you love on a daily basis, it no longer can be called a job. Most of us strive to achieve that state and a startup comes very close to providing this opportunity.\n\u00b7In addition to the above, you have a large say on your work\u2026You enter into a company that is very small in size. Each individual is extremely engrossed in owning his or her piece of work. The only expectation is that you own yours and deliver your best. No pre-defined guidelines constrain you from experimenting or working at your full potential. You start to hear more of \u201cYou tell me should we do take this decision?\u201d You will have a broad vision/goal to start off with and you are left to achieve that goal in the best possible way you can come up with. Being in a small team also means that when you want to change something in the organization your discussions with your colleagues are more meaningful and results are quick. You start to see that your work has a direct impact on the performance on the organization, something that is difficult in other organizations.\n\u00b7Godspeed learning\u2026A startup is always hungry for more. If learning new skills and taking on challenges on a daily basis is something you are yearning for, you have to look no further. You start your growth from day one and it increases exponentially from there on. No false tenure based title changes but only growth in absolute terms. The best part about a startup is that you do not know where it will be few months down the line. It is for you to decide where to take it. No hierarchical structure means that you have the chance to grow at your pace and that is the best reward one can get.\nThe decision to work in a MNC vs a Startup depends from person to person. There are pros and cons to both. If I were to describe them in one line each it would be \u2013 An MNC is a cable car ride with a scenic view and A startup is a bungee jump or a sky dive. You choose!"

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "We have been playing startup for over two years now and have worked with a lot of people to get to the stage we are in now.. All of them have contributed to us some way or the other. But some people have made a larger contribution than others.. While I have never figured out what motivates people to work their asses off for a startup giving up big ticket corporate jobs, I\n\u00a0\nhave learnt\n\u00a0\na few bits about how to identify the people that have the right\n\u00a0\nblood\n\u00a0\nfor a startup. I call them\n\u00a0\nAssasins\n. How do you identify one?\nBeing Stubborn\n: In a startup, it is important -to not drop the ball, to be determined, to be innovative and to find ways to do more than usual.\n\u00a0\nYour\n\u00a0\npeople have to get the job done. And exceed expectations. They need to want to do it and go after it with all their heart. And that is the only reward they should seek. During the interview process, if they want to join your startup, they will leave no stone unturned to do that. Of course, you might have to work hard to make them want it enough. At the end of the interview, if you tell them \u201c\nim\n\u00a0\nsorry you don\u2019t fit the candidature\u201d and see a WTF-No-Way face on them, you know you are talking to the right person.\nBeing Impulsive\n: Once you have put in all your efforts to convince a person to join you, it shouldn\u2019t take much time for the other person to step in. If that doesn\u2019t happen and you get a laundry list of questions which never really mattered even to you, that\u2019s another signal for a wrong guy (or girl). Such questions may or may not include:\nWhat\u2019s your current revenue breakdown by geography and business vertical? [My Answer: Do you really think I have the time to do this math?]\nWhat is your exit strategy? [My Answer: Exits are made after something becomes\n\u00a0\nexitable\n, don\u2019t you think we should work towards that first?]\nBlah\n\u00a0\nBlahBlah\n..!\nSeriously, if you get any of this crap thrown at you, you know who you should throw out.\nBeing Animals\n: This is my\n\u00a0\nfavourite\n\u00a0\nquestion. I ask everyone I interview a very trivial question \u2013 \u201cIf you were to describe yourself as an animal, which one would it be\u201d. The answer for a startup candidate has to be an aggressive animal \u2013 a flesh eater, the king of the jungle who gets what he wants. The absolute worst answers I have heard include a cat, unicorn (really\u2026), and worst of all, a snake (!). Please, I do not want slithery snakes in my startup. Neither do I want rainbow chasing horned horses, this is a startup not a fairy tale\n.\nThis is a commonly asked question in interviews, so some people are trained to answer this in the right way. But a startup is also about emotions. So, if you hear the right answer, but don\u2019t feel it in your gut, you\u2019re probably right.\nBeing Victims\n: Your people should have something to prove. They should not be the best people on paper. If you think that you will be lucky to get someone who has a stellar academic record all throughout his life, you couldn\u2019t be more wrong. Some of these \u2018star\u2019 candidates (no\n\u00a0\noffence\n\u00a0\nto some of my closest friends), sometimes, merely use startups as a stepping stone to get into the best business schools where they can continue to add degrees to their well-polished CVs. The people you hire should seek you to prove something to themselves, their family and their friends. Degrees and brands don\u2019t matter to them. Working in a big company will never give them a chance at doing all the superhuman stuff you do in a startup. For example, it is 2am right now and I have 7 colleagues alive and kicking on my work IM who I can talk to and discuss stuff, something you\u2019d never dream in a corporate\n\u00a0\ndeadjob\n. Only the people who have lived through pain in their lives will be able to plow through the highs and lows of working in a startup. And support you through it.\nIn for the Kill\n: Money should not be the driving factor for someone to join your startup. For the money, they are better off working somewhere else. In fact, whenever I talk to people who are already working somewhere else, I tell them that they will only make 80% of what they used to make in their previous jobs. No exceptions! The actual quantum is not as important as a percentage cut. Saying this will make a lot of people you interview not join you, but it is all for the good. The journey, the thrill and the need to kill is what should matter the most. The long nights to get things done, getting a step closer, outwitting your competition, and reaching a day when you can proudly say \u2013 \u201cwe did it!\u201d Not many people get to say this during their lives. Your people should be working with you to get to that one moment even if this might take many years to get there. But with hard work, determination and team work it will be just like blowing the smoke off the tip of a gun barrel. With the kill at your feet."

        "author": "Deepinder Goyal",
        "content": "The big news last month was our identity change from Foodiebay to Zomato. While this was under consideration for a long time , there were a few things which triggered/encouraged the change:\nWe received funding from\n\u00a0\nInfoedge\n\u00a0\nin August 2010. This gave us some stability as a firm and we rethought where we wanted to be as a company in\n\u00a0\nthe longer\n\u00a0\nterm. An obvious answer was that we would like to venture into verticals adjacent to food. And sticking to the name Foodiebay was definitely not the best option to support this move.\nWhen we had named ourselves Foodiebay, we didn\u2019t notice that we had \u2018ebay\u2019 in our name.\n\u00a0\nthis\n\u00a0\ndidn\u2019t necessarily mean trouble, but one should not build a business\n\u00a0\non\n\u00a0\na name which has a 5% chance of getting screwed in the future. On that note, if you are about to start your own business, it is highly recommended that you read this:\n\u00a0\nGolden Rules\n\u00a0\n\u2013 and DO NOT ignore the importance of any of the points mentioned here \u2013 they are there for a reason.\nPost funding, we were investing a lot\n\u00a0\ninto\n\u00a0\nmarketing our brand. Most of this money would have to be spent again if we delayed\n\u00a0\nrebranding\n\u00a0\nourselves. So we thought that if\n\u00a0\nrebranding\n\u00a0\nwas inevitable, we\u2019d rather do it sooner than later.\n\u00a0\nRebranding\n\u00a0\nhas been a great learning experience for each one of us at Zomato/Foodiebay. We used this as an excuse to fix so many things which were wrong in a single, it was scary and made a lot of us feel nervous. But once the dust settled down, everything became much more efficient and clear.\nSome of the positives that we derived out of our re-branding were:\nA new identity\nWe have been running our business for quite some time now (a few decades\n\u00a0\nin\n\u00a0\nstartup time \u2013 3 years chronologically ). Earlier, we were mostly experimenting with different business models and it is only recently that we saw the bigger picture (we think!). We also understood that we could potentially move into different industry verticals which didn\u2019t ideally fit in well with our old brand identity.\n\u00a0\nRebranding\n\u00a0\ngave us a perfect excuse to redefine our business objectives for\n\u00a0\nthe longer\n\u00a0\nterm.\nA new startup\nThere are only a couple of founders for any startup (haven\u2019t seen startups with more than 3-4\u00a0\nfounders\n\u00a0\nwork). All the other people in the company are, for lack of a better word, employees. That\u2019s because they didn\u2019t build the organization from scratch \u2013 they weren\u2019t there during the most difficult times. Here,\n\u00a0\nrebranding\n\u00a0\nchanged all that. Our team is now 22 members strong and each one of us loves Zomato so much (just like a big founding team) because we all transformed into Zomato together by putting in numerous night-outs on a very tight schedule. Suddenly, we had much more energy in the office and had people taking so much more ownership\n\u00a0\nfor\n\u00a0\ntheir work. A positive sign definitely \u2013 I can easily say that our productivity has gone up by 3-4 times. Of course this doesn\u2019t mean that you should\n\u00a0\nrebrand\n\u00a0\nevery couple of years when your organization grows (that would be disastrous), but if and when you do, try to involve as many people in the process as possible, because they will all end up becoming \u2018founders\u2019 in your team.\nExcuse to redefine our culture\nA lot of our people used to show up at work at different times making teamwork and collaboration difficult. While I am all for a no face-time policy and respect people who get the job done irrespective of where they are, it is sometimes necessary to be in\n\u00a0\noffice\n\u00a0\nfor being more productive in a team environment. At the switch, we put out a list of things we wanted to change at Zomato (which included starting hours\n\u00a0\nfor\n\u00a0\nwork) and everybody just nodded along. With a bigger identity change in the offing, such changes look small and do not stand out as troublesome and inconvenient.\nNew hires and layoffs\nWe also used\n\u00a0\nrebranding\n\u00a0\nas an excuse to let go of some people who were not ideal for a startup environment. We also hired new people who fit in better with our\n\u00a0\nlonger\n\u00a0\nterm strategy. This was a big change\n\u00a0\nfor\n\u00a0\nan organization as well as our people. But fortunately, we handled it well.\nReinvigorated customers\nI cannot explain this better than this comment that we received from an old customer on the blog post announcing the change in our name:\n\u00a0\n\u201cLike they say \u2013 everything changes except change. I like the new name and the idea behind, it speaks volumes about the plan and vision that you and your team has for\n\u00a0\nfoodiebay\n\u2026\n.\nerrr\n\u2026\n\u00a0\nzomato\n! I see the company expanding and being the recommendation engine in the very near future, this is not just a website, it is a movement \u2013 best of luck guys\u201d \u2013 Mrinalika\nExcitement and publicity\nIt is very difficult to stay in the news all the time. You have to keep coming up with disruptive ideas and actions to keep feeding your PR agency regularly.\n\u00a0\nRebranding\n, if you are a decently well-known brand, can be a good excuse to get in touch with all your journalist/reporter contacts to write a story\n\u00a0\non\n\u00a0\nyou and the change. It brings in a lot of new customers to your business and could very well make up for a loss of customers due to the change in name. We did exactly that!\nOn that note, some of the key cons of\n\u00a0\nrebranding\n\u00a0\nin my opinion:\nHate mail and losing loyal customers\nAs a three year old startup, we had our fair share of loyal customers. Some of them didn\u2019t like the change since they could no longer identify themselves with the new name. From some of these, we did get some hate mail. For most of the customers who emailed us, we got back to them promptly and won them back. But I am sure that not everyone emailed us and we lost the love of some customers in the process.\nConfused employees\nThe\n\u00a0\nrebranding\n\u00a0\nput our sales team in utter confusion. It was hard for them to explain the change to their clients. Moreover, since we had been planning this change for around the month, they always questioned if they should talk to new client prospects as Foodiebay or Zomato. It took a lot of perseverance and phone calls\n\u00a0\nto\n\u00a0\nthe team to ensure that no one came to know about Zomato before its time.\nComplicated process\nRebranding\n\u00a0\nhas to be done in a single shot. You can\u2019t take too many days to do it. Once you start creating a list of things which would need to change, it easily seems to run into a couple of dozen pages. Paying attention to the smallest details is important. But what is more important is that all of these changes have to made overnight, without breaking down any of your essential services. This means a lot of preparation and testing to make sure everything is right. In this, there is no room for getting anything wrong at all."

        "content": "Recently we changed our name. If you haven\u2019t read the\n\u00a0\nstory behind the name change\n, you should! We had to do away with our previous logo made by the wonderful guys at\n\u00a0\nTiffinBox\n. In our decision to go with the new brand we decided to try out different options and \u00a0along the way we learnt a thing or two about logo design that we recommend, should you decide the same exercise in the future (or even now). This was our old logo\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis is our new logo\nThe name change brought about a lot of different ideas but at the heart of it all Zomato is still the place for foodies to find and discover great places to eat. We show you the menus of the restaurants and help you discover areas you might not have seen otherwise. The\u00a0vibrancy\u00a0and fun factor was important and in our mission to get the current logo these are things we kept as the guiding factor for choosing a logo.\n\u00a0\nStart with an idea\n\u00a0\nEvery good logo has an idea or appeal towards it. How would you explain your company? What would you show that would closely resemble your idea of the company? That\u2019s the simplest way to start with designing a logo; by defining it. Start with an idea in your head. Interestingly, we had about 4 ideas of what we wanted the Zomato logo to look like by each one of our self-appointed designers, so when we saw designs that closely matched what we had in our head we knew automatically stuff that we could pick out of the lot.\n\u00a0\nChanging the logo is a long drawn process\n\u00a0\nKnow the saying that it takes a \u00a0village to raise a child? There\u2019s an element of that in logo design. When you change the logo, you have many stakeholders to worry about and each bring in their own design experience. To choose a new identity is like choosing what you\u2019ll be known as from now on. A tip here is to identify the people whose ideas matter. Don\u2019t restrict to authority here \u00a0(or else the CEO calls the shots which is not the ideal case in other companies) but involve the people with a good design sense. We had 5 or 6 people we intently listened to and then formed a collective opinion. At the end of the day it\u2019s a family so no ego here.\n\u00a0\nWork with good designers\n\u00a0\nA logo is the identity with which you go everywhere. So this is an area you spend money wisely. There are some great designers you can work with in India. We had an internal debate on working with freelancers versus top designers versus crowdsourcing the logo. \u00a0We took samples from all of them and honestly what we found that is working with an\u00a0independent\u00a0designer is a great idea. The shortcoming is that you don\u2019t get many iterations on the logo and they usually juggle many projects so it\u2019s an iffy for the amount of attention you\u2019ll get for your particular project. The interesting thing we found with crowd \u00a0sourcing the logo (referring to the excellent 99designs.com) is that you get tons of choices to sift through and some of these people are very high quality designers. We got an overwhelming response for the logos after explaining it in a well written draft about what we wanted. A quick tip here is to wait towards the end of the project, that\u2019s usually when we get the highest quality entries (because as with everything good things come to those who wait).\n\u00a0\nKeep in mind the scalability and don\u2019t forget the favicon.ico\n\u00a0\nWhen you use your logo you should keep in mind that you\u2019ll be using it in your posters, in your merchandise (caps, buttons, tshirts) and boardwalk signs. Your logo should translate to all these areas in a memorable way. \u00a0Not forgetting the favicon.ico\u00a0almost eliminated a couple of great designs we had because there was no way that would convert to a favicon and since most of us at Zomato are web junkie online enthusiasts, such a thing just didn\u2019t fly.\n\u00a0\nEvery logo has a memorable shape\n\u00a0\nWhenever you make a logo make sure it\u2019s not just the font that appeals. If you look around you\u2019ll see that some of the greatest logos have a very iconic look and something that translates to just the symbol and not the whole font. That doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t accept logos that are font specific.\n\u00a0\nDifferent backgrounds\n\u00a0\nA good logo designer gives you a good logo when it can work on any background and it should work in black and white; because for us in India we get printouts in black and white mostly. This also eliminates fancy gradients that are (ab)used these days in the name of Web 2.0. A good logo is timeless after all where one look \u00a0reminds you of it\u2019s awesomeness.\n\u00a0\nIntroduce some fun into it\n\u00a0\nThe tomato you see has been zorrofied. We came up with fun stuff for our name prelaunch hinting \u201cwhat would happen if Zorro painted the vegetable town red?\u201d. If you have seen the movie Zorro you\u2019ll see how he slashes the Z over the screen. We thought we are quite cool like that too. The important thing is to keep it fun/cute/interesting and not restrict to the pure abstract where most people end up going into. Have you rebranded before? What are your tips? What do you think of our logo, we love comments so do post/shout and let us know what you think."

        "content": "It has been a year since me, Pankaj and Gunjan quit our jobs to focus on Foodiebay. Foodiebay passed many milestones in the last year \u2013 we served 2 million customers, launched our services in two more cities \u2013 Pune and Bangalore, and now list more than 8,000 restaurants on the website. One of the largest Internet companies in India, Infoedge, also noticed our progress and gave us the much needed breathing space to grow bigger, faster. But we still think that this is Day 1 for Foodiebay. Our customers have grown to love our website for bringing the most comprehensive and accurate information about restaurants in 5 cities across India.\u00a0 But, never being satisfied, one of the things that we do is to get out of our comfort zone to provide more information and be more relevant to our users. So far our users were limited to certain cities and countries and technology platforms. Not anymore. We plan to expand not only to more cities in India but to countries as well. Starting next year we plan to go international in our offerings and it\u2019s not just that, we want to offer you more than just restaurant directory listings. As a product, we want to evolve into a recommendation engine that suggests you the best places to order home delivery from or to dine-out at. We are also planning to launch a nightlife section very soon. Overall, the question we want to answer for you in the longer term is \u2013 \u201cWhere should I go today\u201d? We saw that if we wanted to touch broader horizons then the name \u201cFoodiebay\u201d wasn\u2019t going to be the best option since it might restrict our perception as just a food website. And right now was the time to reflect deeply and think about what we should be christened as especially since we are going to invest heavily in marketing the brand. Another thought that was at the back of our minds was to prevent any overstepping of ebay when we start accepting online payments.\u00a0 Given these goals, we put our heads to the grindstone and thought a lot about it the last 2 weeks. All this wasn\u2019t easy because we love Foodiebay as much as you do. So we decided to keep the idea of food at the center but choose a name that is timeless and encompassing. We decided on the name Zomato. Zomato\u2019s got a zing to it and is originally a play on the word Tomato. Zomato is not restricted to food either. Changing the name of a business is never easy. We have built a reasonable amount of brand equity over years and we stand to lose it all. But realistically, we saw that we were approaching a wall and we had to take a couple of steps back to jump over it. And with a\n\u00a0\nteam\n\u00a0\nmost startups can only dream of, we are confident that we will pull this off successfully. What next? A lot of new things:\nWhen exactly are we changing to Zomato?\nStarts at 14 November 2010: 12AM (it might take the whole day); but don\u2019t worry, our life saving services (menus) will still work on both Foodiebay.com and Zomato.com\nNew Logo\nIt\u2019s all over zomato.com. What do you think of it?\nNewsletter\nYou guys loved Crunch but we sort of went silent on that one didn\u2019t we? Well no more, we aim to cover the best that places have to offer with everything related to food. Don\u2019t be surprised to find tantalizing foodshots in this one along with great deals.\nNew Office\nWe decided that change should begin with the location. We have moved our office area to a bigger joint. Have you checked out our video yet?\nNew Design\nWell a logo change alone wouldn\u2019t do now would it? With our expansive goals and ambitions, we decided we\u2019ll get a new dress for ourselves. The ordering\u2019s done, the stitching\u2019s taking some time but we should have ourselves well decked by the end of the year.\nNew Interactions\nA lot of you asked for recommendations on where to eat and sometimes what to eat. We heard you, with our new design we plan to introduce our recommendations list. It doesn\u2019t stop there, we\u2019ll soon tell you where your friends have been, what they enjoyed eating and where/what you should be eating too!\nNew Mobile App!\nWouldn\u2019t you love to satisfy your hunger on the go without having to take out that laptop and check out the details, well fear no more. Whether you are powered by the Android, Blackberry, Symbian or the iPhone you should be able to check our geo-location based applications very soon.\nNew Recruits\nFoodies will henceforth be christened as Zomans. Oh and btw, we are still hiring for tech and designer positions. Do send us an email at\n\u00a0\njobs@zomato.com\n\u00a0\nif you think you fit the Zill (bill with a Z..!)\nFAQ\nWhat happens to Foodiebay.com?\n\u00a0\nRest assured all the information is still retained and redirected to Zomato.com so you don\u2019t lose out on the treasure of information we had on Foodiebay. In fact we plan to add a lot more.\n\u00a0\nHas the team left?\n\u00a0\nNot at all. If anything they are more into this.\n\u00a0\nDoes it have something to do with some other name?\n\u00a0\nWell somewhat but mainly because we want to be more than just food.\n\u00a0\nIs zomato pronounced as zoh-mah-to? or Zoy-may-to? or Zoo-mey-to?\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019d prefer the first but a rose is a rose by any other name as Shakespeare said.\n\u00a0\nCan I send feedback?\n\u00a0\nSure just send an email to\n\u00a0\ninfo@zomato.com\n; or write to me directly at\n\u00a0\ndeepinder@zomato.com\n\u00a0\nIs anything going to be paid?\n\u00a0\nIf you wish to donate to us, we love food. You can get it delivered to our new address in the Gurgaon. But we will never ask you for cash.\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m Hungry. How can you help?\n\u00a0\nCheck out\u00a0\nzomato.com"
